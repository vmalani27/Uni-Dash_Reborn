	- CCNP (Professional)
	- CCIE (Expert)
What’s changing includes:
DevNet Certifications Are Transitioning to Cisco Automation Certifications
What this means for you: The DevNet Associate certification exam will be renamed to CCNA Automation. No changes will be made to the exam topics for this certification. Anyone holding an active DevNet Associate certification will automatically be transitioned to CCNA Automation after February 3, 2025. We are not renaming the DevNet Associate course from Cisco Networking Academy at this time.
Cybersecurity certifications will be CCNA Cybersecurity and CCNP Cybersecurity
What this means for you: The Cybersecurity Associate certification will be renamed to CCNA Cybersecurity. No changes will be made to the exam topics for this certification. Anyone holding an active Cybersecurity Associate exam will automatically be transitioned to CCNA Cybersecurity after February 3, 2025.

Hey there,

We’re about to kick off the ✨world’s largest hackathon✨, and we’re starting it off with an unforgettable party. On May 7th, join us for Unleash the Vibes (https://d5llC804.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/DQ+113/d5llC804/VWtMKt2nvpMSN8cn1FXNgK2XW8JC1R55v74rjMBB8TY3pyd0W7Y8-PT6lZ3lXW13wm7b2KCBfqW47DT7M78MbxfW9fnH344H19ZTW2wSQyS5NQb0NW68mNVt6C8nbvW8LTwkZ52ZsX4W2tV_Tp8kJBPxW2qSnH48Fgfn2N5Hg6wSFL1PSW9lqY7r3KFy6wW8_2ZrP9fhxZJW7pr5lT7Jqt1pW63dVbH4xtZs_W64vBB06M3RFgW6YP3-53Q5y6nW2PxbKY3W35TvW7Yhr7N2j5h95W36BLDB9jYH_cVS7wp03S0-v6VqYVX-37lfR4W8ztP5j8s7mytW3kQ9497SG3KxN1b_8mrVkr1NV5pwyq6sF2s2N1xxbXgbkJTKW6jtVBR5Bq2Hsf4rLvyF04 ) — an invite-only experience where Bolt teams up with The Chainsmokers to throw a party like no other.

Step into a vaporwave-inspired dreamscape, where the lighting’s brighter, the drinks are stronger, and the music’s louder. Trust us, this is a party you won’t want to miss.

The festivities start at 5 PM at Bolt Park, that’s open for everyone with free food from some of our favorite local food trucks. Once the clock strikes 7 PM, we’re going invite-only for an exclusive indoor concert you’ll never forget.

But when the doors open at 7pm, entry becomes exclusive. This isn’t a conference afterparty—it’s THE party. And here’s the catch:

Joining the waitlist doesn’t guarantee entry. Maybe you'll get in, maybe you won't... you'll never know unless you try. You'll need to win your way in… or get the kind of invite that money can’t buy.

👩‍🎤 Spots are limited.

🤘 Swag is real.

🪩 The vibes will be next level.

Add your name to the waitlist now for a shot at joining us:

Build production-ready generative AI solutions to transform your organization
In recent years, AI Inference––the process of running trained models to generate predictions—has become a major focus in AI development, especially with the rise of large language models (LLMs) like GPT, Llama, and Gemini. For the successful use of AI inference, organizations need a full-stack approach that supports the end-to-end AI life cycle and tools that enable teams to meet their goals. With NVIDIA AI Enterprise stack we enable enterprises to build production-ready generative AI solutions to transform your organization. 

 Join us for an engaging webinar where we'll explore key considerations for deploying and scaling generative AI in production, including the critical role of AI inference. 

 Don't miss out on this opportunity to accelerate your enterprise journey with NVIDIA AI Enterprise software:

 In this webinar, you'll gain a deep understanding of LLM inference theory and applications, learning about:


	- Efficient prompt processing and token-generation techniques
	- Inference performance optimisations using TRT-LLM and NVIDIA Triton
	- LLM performance measurement with GenAI-Perf, hosted on TensorRT-LLM and Triton, and a text summarisation use case
	- Real-world case studies

Thank you for being a valued part of the NVIDIA GTC community.

 GTC 2025 is happening in just two weeks—March 17–21 in San Jose, CA. This year’s conference will be our most ambitious yet, featuring 1,000+ sessions, expanded venues, hands-on technical workshops, and the opportunity to connect with the brightest minds shaping the future of AI and accelerated computing.

 If you can join us in person in San Jose, great. We anticipate selling out, so I suggest you register soon.

 If you’re interested in the conference but can't attend the physical event, you can register for the virtual conference, which is free of charge.

 With the virtual conference, you'll get access to the keynote livestream, live-broadcasted sessions, exclusive interviews, and demos. You’ll also be able to participate in expert training, explore research posters, attend sponsored sessions, and view virtual and on-demand sessions.

 Register for either in-person or virtual attendance here <https://go.nvidianews.com/MTU2LU9GTi03NDIAAAGY_qE_0dOUjCLzj5PhLhNRFoPNccsEaBpGaDiLUVA1c4JOWL_leI-6dp09aWWqDrvscTRiCEw=>.

*Hackathon Heroes: Fueling Innovation with MLH & Hack Club*
***********************************************************

( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzhdjXb5_E&ab_channel=MajorLeagueHacking )

At GitHub Education, we’re proud to power hackathons with Major League Hacking (MLH) ( https://mlh.io/ ) —1 million members strong, reaching *1 in 3* *U.S.* *CS grads* —and Hack Club ( https://hackclub.com/ ) , whose High Seas event drew *20,000+ signups* and over *7k new projects*.

These gatherings spark incredible creativity, from running Doom in a PDF ( https://github.com/Rochet2/DOOM-in-PDF ) to building a Minecraft server in Rust, and help students level up on GitHub. In fact, *most MLH members* become more active on GitHub after joining, thanks in part to the Student Developer Pack ( https://education.github.com/pack ) and GitHub Copilot.

( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iaO0r09yRA&ab_channel=MajorLeagueHacking )

Curious to see hackathons in action? Check out ⏯️ MLH’s GitHub-powered highlights ( https://youtu.be/1hzhdjXb5_E ) or their ⏯️ 24-hour “Squid Game” robot build ( https://youtu.be/5iaO0r09yRA ) —then sign up ( https://mlh.io/ ) to bring your next big idea to life!

Build Your GitHub Skills with Certifications & Copilot
******************************************************

( https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/150827 )

Looking to boost your coding skills and job prospects? If you’re a *verified student* , you can take the *GitHub Foundations Certification exam* at no cost through the Student Developer Pack ( https://education.github.com/pack ). It covers essential GitHub topics like version control and collaboration—capabilities employers value in real-world development. Need a place to start? The Microsoft Learning Path for GitHub Foundations ( https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/github-foundations/ ) offers a step-by-step guide. Once you’re ready, visit the Foundations Certificate page ( https://education.github.com/experiences/foundations_certificate ) to redeem your free voucher.

Want to go further? Verified students also get *GitHub Copilot Pro* , which has more features than the free tier and helps you code faster and smarter.
