As per the company's feedback, none of the submitted tasks met the required quality standards, and it was observed that a significant number of submissions were copied or lacked originality. Due to this, no students have been selected at this stage.

Thank you ma'am for the reply. Currently I am in final year so as for now
campus placements and many things parallelly going on. Because of that not
able to join lecture regularly. Last I have attended lectures of your just
before file handling. After including that not.

Question is that can I directly asked that what to submit to get eligible
for cirtificate. Because of my tight schedule I will not able to through
each and every part. Due to that I am requesting to share the things which
I have to submit. So I can focus directly on that only when I get empty
slots.
