Happy Friday builders!

We’ve partnered with our friends at Entri (https://d5llC804.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/DQ+113/d5llC804/MVsGVTRvSMjW46pS-B3T_nshW8cYYgJ5xMCCgN72QTZR3lcq-W69sMD-6lZ3n1W8rvkPv4Jm4FlW88Wz8g25T2n5W1Cqc9y1SP2mkN5xXM959XC_0W6fs3JT1PgdT0W13rxzq3srqLzN7P074zpng5HW3tM3sj2QVzg9N7Gww6cYK5dVVyydZ_4TVbHsN5tmqqkVjftJW8WQTyJ5Hm_bcW3wtvTl8j2yDWW5gB74b2Jm6wdN7bKG5bxtcllW5XnMr_2qdGc-W72zz5V44bS5ZW4P5wcC8BBSYJW5dJzWK6X12k4W3t6Jhs86RwRCf8RRnLq04 ) to bring you this email full of exciting news and updates.

First, we can’t stress enough how inspiring it’s been to see you all hackin’ away this week, whether it’s solo, as part of a team, or just collabing and co-working in the same spaces on Discord together (https://d5llC804.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/DQ+113/d5llC804/MVsGVTRvSMjW46pS-B3T_nshW8cYYgJ5xMCCgN72QTZR3lcq-W69sMD-6lZ3m8VmZwS58lFYLzW2P1G7n80zNW8VpMVYB6dR2L_N66Wppt7WMDtW3Z7PDR2CqYQ8W6hFHHz2JS588W8vdVTc8cVv0sVzWCX34nwt0fW2lgTMn5nPL-vW6m7VGZ12nRG8N3CMYnqxTsq_MkmgM7yQjPbW1prXKW8QYd_kW70dTxT61zG-YW7S8BwK2T1GS9W9l-PHS1ShLs8W20fDHq71-lChW3cJgMp7nQC1yW7sDTkQ3BBQXcW5n1dSR8HKSHff2R7Q-n04 ) . You should feel proud of what you’ve already accomplished, and we’re cheering big for you as you approach the halfway mark.

Team rules clarification

A lot of you had questions about submitting entries as a team, so we’ve made it more clear in the official rules (https://d5llC804.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/DQ+113/d5llC804/MVsGVTRvSMjW46pS-B3T_nshW8cYYgJ5xMCCgN72QT-q3lcq-W7lCdLW6lZ3l1W2sYDHJ2sgGWdW7v2tyT562jKJW3MPGqY5KyXD_W4hYZW92SWFLJW8QrRfM3wYQqxW4g7Fx-7_stVqW7_cVJm2GsmzrW5nd1-q2K45X2W83mXdY5RbFKFW79TxYR10lM4lVBRx321SgS9qW1wXrHQ92nNhTW8wqnrm7Z760HW4hcJQn1tgJB5W3_DGPL7q8ZNsW5VjmP37ZHMDGW9gJBtw3kZR87W3CKvtz7hQzhbV2T9zs7ZFktsW2w-jfg2zwhNvN5g9QH03N19jVTr0B289TpwvW2XFXY71ZkTHmW7PnkTz3Z_kWYdz9Sqj04 ) . TL;DR: A team or org must appoint and authorize one individual to represent, act, and enter a submission on their behalf, and all team members must meet the official eligibility requirements.

Builder Pack update

If you registered but haven’t received your Builder Pack yet, we’re on it. With nearly 100k builders, we ran out of Bolt codes faster than expected. We’re generating more and reaching out to sponsors for extra codes. As soon as we’ve got everything, the rest of the packs will ship via email. We appreciate your patience!

Get featured in the Hackathon Docuseries

Greg Isenberg and an Emmy Award-winning crew are filming a documentary (https://d5llC804.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/DQ+113/d5llC804/MVsGVTRvSMjW46pS-B3T_nshW8cYYgJ5xMCCgN72QT-q3lcq-W7lCdLW6lZ3l6W4jdz9s1jJbPQW6px5sb87R9qbW7b630-35dNJSW5KKvN07Q_3x5W5xMWfY1cG1ncW6X03br90t6Z4W1MY5mg1WJmT7N6LXtt6_sc9sW2ZVn_Q7R_r4NW1hpBCn4pKtNDN1D0P1mPKhdnN1Y3kLGMTfF9W83CZMY2B__y9W7hB3GH885bKNW2BS2qf2xntFNW67qKKZ6WmsCBW1f562L8wlyBtW6srlKV7Sg0BKW7TKLwr4rHXDYW27D08f33Qpc7W5l8vcJ64VH-gN7sRQ-tnFvsXV-pJKX1mxdxfW1VGvh846zzxnf5fJyS604 ) to explore the AI Gold Rush and they'll be featuring builders from the World's Largest Hackathon. The series will reach millions, making it an incredible opportunity to share your story, showcase your project, and maybe even land your first customer.

If you’re interested in being considered in the documentary:

- Film yourself (and your team) working on your project, telling your story, and sharing your progress. Content can include selfie or vlog-style videos, Zoom and Discord calls, and anything else you capture throughout your journey.
- Fill out the submission form (https://d5llC804.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/DQ+113/d5llC804/MVsGVTRvSMjW46pS-B3T_nshW8cYYgJ5xMCCgN72QT-K3lcq-W7Y8-PT6lZ3pXVsc8794Z6W40VvPHXd2dk0fHW6Y-NZS26YJlsVTnQ968fl46-VJnncV6cKqgjW78fg6t2Z_6DDW7TBnK22GFg37W3y2_KQ2WlXzsW5dSn_D6ST5P9W8V0NLp55_hRRW6XL-TL1Yp_V9W7pkzly2hPzzzW90P2Kh5ccX7FW2f_mX08cF5g0W87HCYl5DpvZTW15G1_C3Mn23nW3cFPHH261lxLW2nt5K72mJ7yhW4-pDlm6prLwgVfNk683bj7NfW6zGDNw8xM4n9W62sTdq5c3b8ZW6nknQT8KWKMJW7G6gWh1tZcPbW4HvbN97yvgmJN9f4YzHkf-CLf3YFtZb04 ) , where you will also upload your footage.

--------
May 2025
--------

May brought fresh AI tools, career wisdom, and community wins—everything below is ready for you to watch, fork, or RSVP.

*What's inside:*

* 🏗️ Build 2025 highlights
* 🎯 Vibe coding roadmap
* 🌱 Junior-dev success guide
* 🎓 500 Campus Experts
* 🛠 Maintainer Month rewind
* 📺 Open Source Friday spotlight
* 👩‍💻 Hack Club Athena Award
* ⛺ MLH Hackcon 2025
* 🌍 Copilot Global Bootcamp
* ⭐️ Trending repo: developer-roadmap

🏗️ Build 2025: five launches you can try today
----------------------------------------------

Build dropped a bundle of student-friendly AI updates—here's what you can spin up right now:

*1) GitHub Copilot Chat goes open-source.* The extension's code is being merged into the main microsoft/vscode repo, so you can fork it, add custom slash-commands, and submit pull requests guided by the CONTRIBUTING doc.

*2) GitHub Copilot agent mode in VS Code Insiders.* Install the latest Insiders build and the Copilot Chat extension; agent mode now appears automatically in the Chat view, chaining refactors, test runs, and rollbacks—an ideal playground for prompt engineering.

*3) GitHub Copilot coding agent (public preview).* Click Run with Copilot on any issue and the agent branches, edits, commits, and opens a pull request with a full audit log. The preview is currently limited to Copilot Pro + and Enterprise subscribers for now.

*4) GitHub Models Hub.* Pin GPT-4o, Claude 3, or Gemini 1.5 to a repo, benchmark latency versus quality, and share prompt presets—no API-key juggling required.

*5) Microsoft Copilot multi-agent DevOps preview.* Watch three Microsoft Copilot agents collaborate: an infra agent provisions Azure Bicep, a doc agent rewrites the README, and a work-item agent files follow-up issues—your crash course in AI-driven teamwork.

🎯 ""Vibe coding"" roadmap: your GPS to AI mastery
-----------------------------------------------

The new guide splits the AI journey into four snack-size phases: a Python and math refresh, data-wrangling drills with Kaggle, hands-on LLM engineering, and a ship-it capstone that deploys a model to the new GitHub Models Hub. Each phase links to starter repos, good-first-issue boards, and 90-second explainer videos so you can build a portfolio as you learn.

Finish by crafting a README with a model card, evaluation notebook, and GIF demo—exactly what hiring managers (and Copilot) parse first. Bonus: the guide teaches you to A/B test GPT-4o vs Claude 3 using Copilot's Model Picker.

Follow the roadmap ( https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/vibe-coding-your-roadmap-to-becoming-an-ai-developer/ )

🌱 Thriving as a junior engineer: field-tested playbook
------------------------------------------------------

First internship or grad scheme on the horizon? The latest GitHub Blog article distills advice from engineering managers at Shopify, NASA, and Stripe. Core habits: ask ""why"" in every code review, keep a living ""aha!"" journal, and time-box rabbit holes so you ship and learn in parallel.

Author Yelyzaveta Kramarenko suggests pairing sessions, writing docs as you debug, and contributing to open source to beat impostor syndrome. Leads get guidance too: shape bite-size tickets, use scaffolded PR templates, and celebrate small-win merges.

The downloadable checklist doubles as a 1-on-1 agenda—perfect for your next stand-up.

🎓 About 500 GitHub Campus Experts—and how to join them
------------------------------------------------------

The program that began with 15 pioneers in 2017 has now reached *500 Campus Experts across 67 countries*. In 2024 alone they ran 1,240 workshops, mentored 28K peers, and secured $320K in sponsorship for student hackathons.

Campus Experts receive detailed support for events they run on their campuses and in their communities, and a bunch of other amazing perks for active members. We're looking forward to the next 500 Experts, and one of them can be you!

Applications reopen in July, so start drafting your campus-impact proposal now!

🛠 Maintainer Month rewind: students, mentors, momentum
------------------------------------------------------

*Kick-off: MLH Fellowship showcase.* One hundred twenty-eight fellows merged 620 pull requests into 18 open-source projects—including a GPU compiler, a Django security dashboard, and new ESLint rules for Astro. Veteran maintainers like Mehdi Khodja streamed weekly code reviews so students could watch ""why"" as well as ""what."" Learn more about the MLH Fellowship ( https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/159852 ).

*Mid-month: Appwrite AMA + showcase.* The backend-as-a-service team fielded 70+ community questions on auth pitfalls, edge scaling, and their new AI-assist CLI. Meanwhile, the Built with Appwrite ( https://builtwith.appwrite.io/ ) gallery crossed 120 student apps—everything from a pizza tracker to a mindfulness bot.

*Finale: New Relic × OpenTelemetry live demo.* Maintainer Reese Lee instrumented the Astro Shop demo and turned a single PR into latency graphs and error heat-maps—all live on Twitch. Missed it? The VOD is waiting on our GitHub Education Twitch channel ( https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2470777872 ).

Relive Maintainer Month ( https://maintainermonth.github.com )

📺 Open Source Friday: feature your project live on stream
---------------------------------------------------------

Every Friday at 1 PM ET, hosts Andrea Griffiths and Kedasha Kerr chat with a maintainer on GitHub's main Twitch channel ( https://www.twitch.tv/github ). Projects like Homebrew and Astro doubled contributor traffic within 48 hours, and each episode lives forever on the YouTube playlist ( https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0lo9MOBetEFmtstItnKlhJJVmMghxc0P&feature=shared ).

*Why join?* Showcase your work to thousands of devs, demo new features live, and inspire first-time contributors. *How to apply:* make sure your repo meets the project criteria ( https://github.com/githubevents/open-source-friday/blob/main/admin/project-criteria.md ) (OSI license + CONTRIBUTING guide + 5 help-wanted issues), then open the guest-invite template ( https://github.com/githubevents/open-source-friday/issues/new?template=osf-guest-invite.yml&assignees=AndreaGriffiths11%2CLadyKerr&labels=open-source%2Copen-source-friday%2Cpending%2Ctwitch ).

You'll get a rehearsal call, custom Twitch overlays, and promotion to GitHub's multi-million-dev social channels. Game engines, bio-data sets, niche CLI tools—all are welcome.

***********************************

----------
April 2025
----------

Spring is full of growth—and we're not just talking about the trees. This month we’re marking two decades of Git, prepping you for summer learning, and sharing fresh opportunities to code for good.

*What's inside:*

* 🎉 Git turns 20
* 🧪 Certification voucher deadline
* 🤖 Pick your perfect Copilot model
* 🔓 Global Hack Week: Open Source
* 🌍 Earth-day saplings at IIT Bombay
* 🌱 Climate Action Plan for developers
* 🧑‍🦯 Emojis + plain-language tips
* 🎤 Call for speakers: Git Merge 2025

🎉 Git turns 20
--------------

“I didn’t set out to change the world, I just needed a better tool.” In a 28-minute Q&A, Linus Torvalds looks back on *20 years of Git* —from its lightning-fast nine-day creation to what’s next, from partial clones to virtual file systems. Come for the origin story, stay for Linus’ advice to the next generation of maintainers.

Watch Linus' full Q&A ( https://github.blog/open-source/git/git-turns-20-a-qa-with-linus-torvalds/ )

🧪 June 30: cert vouchers expire
-------------------------------

Heads-up, Developer Pack members! The current batch of *free GitHub Foundations exam vouchers* disappears on *June 30 2025*. Redeem yours now and schedule the test at your convenience. Vouchers will pause while we migrate to a new platform—but they’ll be back this fall and expanded to teachers, too. Need a refresher? Walk through the GitHub Foundations Learning Path ( https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/github-foundations/ ) or tackle bite-size challenges at GitHub Skills ( https://skills.github.com/ ).

Don't miss out ( https://education.github.com/experiences/foundations_certificate )

🤖 Find your ideal Copilot model
-------------------------------

*Claude 3* ? *Gemini 1.5 Pro* ? *GPT-4o* ? Copilot now lets you switch among models from Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI. This guide breaks down latency, context length, and creative strengths, then offers a three-step framework to A/B test models in your own repos. Your takeaway: match the model to the job—code completion, doc drafting, or architecture brainstorming—and swap any time from Settings → AI models.

Explore the guide ( https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/a-guide-to-deciding-what-ai-model-to-use-in-github-copilot/ )

🔓 Global Hack Week: Open Source
-------------------------------

Seven days. Dozens of live workshops. Unlimited pull requests. From *May 9–15* , *MLH’s Global Hack Week* celebrates everything open source. Build alongside maintainers, tackle daily challenges for swag, and learn how to land your first contribution—100% free and fully virtual, so you can hack from wherever you are.

Claim your spot ( https://ghw.mlh.io/events/open-source )

🌍 Earth-Day saplings at IIT Bombay
----------------------------------

Swag → saplings. During COO Kyle Daigle’s campus visit, the IIT Bombay community swapped stickers for seedlings— *500 young trees* planted in partnership with SankalpTaru Foundation, inspired by Professor Varsha Apte. It’s a small but real step in our long-term sustainability roadmap: fewer material giveaways, more green giveaways.

See our climate work ( https://github.com/social-impact/focus-areas/environmental-sustainability )

🌱 Climate Action Plan for developers
------------------------------------

Your pull requests can cut carbon. This *Climate Action Plan* surfaces tools like CodeCarbon (measure emissions) and Electricity Maps (track realtime grid intensity), plus a directory of 60K+ climate-tech repos. Whether you’re optimizing ML training or building low-energy front-ends, you’ll find starter issues and best practices to green your workflow.

Dig into the plan ( https://github.com/social-impact/focus-areas/environmental-sustainability/climate-action-plan-for-developers )

🧑‍🦯 A11y Skills: Emojis + plain language
----------------------------------------

*Week 3 of Accessibility Skills* dives into two quick wins: pick emojis with built-in meaning (✅ over “✨”), and rewrite jargon-heavy docs into everyday language. The discussion thread includes worksheet examples, a linter you can drop into CI, and a challenge to update one paragraph of your README—then share before-and-after screenshots.

Join the learning ( https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/157840 )

🎤 Call for speakers: Git Merge 2025
-----------------------------------

Got a Git story, workflow win, or research project worth sharing? *Git Merge 2025* is now accepting talk proposals through *May 13*. Join a global lineup of developers, maintainers, and teams pushing Git forward—travel assistance available for selected student speakers.

Submit your talk ( https://git-merge.com/ )

👋 Until next time
-----------------

That’s a wrap on April! Thanks for being part of the GitHub Education community. Keep building, keep learning, and we’ll see you next month.

Hey there, 

I'm back in your inbox with some exciting updates!

 Major Supabase upgrades landed
https://stackblitz.emlnk1.com/lt.php?x=3DZy~GE5UIacD5B-ydDIWBGc1HAnutPvj-UvkKLDInCcEK.u_Ey.zuRs3I2ljdH2nutAYHfFIk
We're thrilled to announce that the Bolt x Supabase integration just got even better!  You can now connect your Bolt projects directly to your existing Supabase databases, pause and resume projects from Bolt, disconnect when needed, and configure details of a new project. 

Want to build both a web app and a mobile app? Great news - both can use the same Supabase database! This means less work for you and fewer headaches when managing your projects. 

Try it now! Click the Supabase button in the top right corner to explore all new connection options. Learn more in our announcement on X https://stackblitz.emlnk1.com/lt.php?x=3DZy~GE5UIacD5B-ydDIWBGc1HAnutPvj-UvkKLDInCcEK.u_Ey.zuRs3I2ljdH2nutAYHfFIk.

** More platform improvements **

* 

**Smarter debugging:** We've implemented SotA debugging that uses advanced reasoning to solve problems faster (while using
90% fewer tokens). The first users get access today, with a full rollout happening over the next few weeks. Learn more in our announcement on X https://stackblitz.emlnk1.com/lt.php?x=3DZy~GE5UIacD5B-ydDIWBGc1HAnutPvj-UvkKLDInCcEK.u_Ey.zuRs3I2ljdH2nutAYHfFKk.

* 

**Fewer building errors:** We've implemented an update that means less of the ""Failed building the project"" error message.

* 

**Improved Expo experience:** We've enhanced the experience around handling images, icons, and fonts.

* 

**Faster performance:** We've upgraded our infrastructure so Bolt now boots and responds up to 5x faster, especially on slower connections.

As always, we'd love to hear your feedback! We have something big planned for next week so be sure to stay tuned! 

Happy building,

Unfortunately, we were unable to verify your academic affiliation based on the information you submitted on Sep 26, 2024 for @anand-chaniyara-college.

 - Please secure your GitHub account with two-factor authentication.  You may need to log out and log back in to GitHub before reapplying.
 - Please complete your GitHub billing information with your full name exactly as it appears in your academic affiliation document. You do not have to add a payment method. You may need to log out and log back in to GitHub before reapplying. If you have only a single legal name, enter it in both the first and last name fields.
 - Please use your device camera to submit academic affiliation documents. 
 - You are unlikely to be verified until you have completed your GitHub user profile with your full name exactly as it appears in your academic affiliation document. Please do not use a variation of your name or a nickname. Once you have updated your profile information log out and log back into GitHub before re-applying.
Once you have resolved the issues with your submission, visit https://education.github.com to reapply.

None of the election dates clash with","Dear Student,

We wanted to take a moment to address an important matter regarding the
upcoming election dates and their potential impact on your exam schedule.


   1.

   None of the election dates clash with scheduled exam dates. If we
   schedule additional dates, we will ensure they again do not clash with
   elections in your state.
   2.

   Hence this is to confirm that there will be no changes to the exam dates
   and they are the same as previously scheduled. We may have exams in some
   cities on April 19 and April 26 depending on seat availability on
   scheduled dates. But again this will be done ensuring we don't conduct
   exams on election dates in your state.
   3.

   Your academic progress and success remain our top priority, and we are
   committed to maintaining the integrity of the examination process.
   4.

   We have more than 6 lakh learners registered for April exams and
   logistics has been a huge challenge. We understand that some of you may
   need to travel to your native cities to participate in the voting process.
   Please remember that you selected your exam cities during registration, and
   it is crucial that you return to these cities to take your exams as
   scheduled. Since hall ticket and center allocation is under process, exam
   cities selected by you during exam registration cannot be changed now.


Hence, we kindly request that you make the necessary arrangements to ensure
you can both exercise your right to vote and fulfill your academic
obligations.

Warm Regards,

NPTEL Team.
