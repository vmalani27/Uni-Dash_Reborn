As promised, your data will be used *strictly for academic purposes*, and *only
informational emails* will be processed. Your contribution will also be
acknowledged in our final presentation/report.

To make the process simple, we’ve prepared a Google Drive folder containing:

   A script that will extract only academic emails from your inbox

📂 Folder link:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PbOQD_oKgAsZ9pWPrY62nWme5xyJr6JD?usp=sharing


📤 Once the extraction is done, please upload your output here:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NNd3t-VRDvEbDpGLDJOCsyBMA1t19Pdz?usp=sharing
------------------------------

⚠️ *Important:*
To make the process smoother and more efficient, we’ll be conducting the *email

Dear Students,

It is highly disappointing to note that despite prior communication and
repeated reminders, *only a limited number of students *have reported on
the first official day of the Third Semester, i.e., *23rd June 2025*.

Let us be absolutely clear—*regular classes and laboratory sessions have
commenced as per the academic calendar*, and your absence is viewed as a
serious breach of academic responsibility. This lack of seriousness and
disregard for institutional guidelines will not be tolerated.

All students who have not reported are hereby instructed to join *without
further delay*. Continued absenteeism will result in:

   -

   *Marking of attendance as ‘Absent’ from Day 1 onwards | **Strict
   disciplinary action as per the institute norms*

We expect every student to uphold the discipline, commitment, and integrity
expected from a professional academic environment. No further excuses will
be entertained.

*Report to the institute immediately.*

regards,

Subject: ProtoQuik Launchpad, Cohort 1: Robotics from iCreate

I am reaching out to you to introduce *ProtoQuik Launchpad, Cohort 1*:
*Robotics*, and seeking your help to identify and attract high-potential
teams and innovators. It would be immensely helpful if you could share the
attached outreach material with your network of students, alumni,
faculty-led startups, or affiliated incubation centers. More details are
available in the attached brochure and webpage:
https://protoquik.icreate.org.in/

This one-of-a-kind programme is designed to help students, innovators and
startups bridge the critical *TRL-4 to TRL-7 gap* – often referred to as
the “*Valley of Death*”. Through a *fully sponsored* and intensive
*30-day* journey,
selected participants will gain:
✅ Up to ₹200K prototyping support
✅ Opportunity to pitch for funding from a ₹20 Million pool
✅ Expert-led sessions & one-on-one mentoring
✅ Support to refine your prototype into an MVP
✅ Access to mentors, designers, vendors & suppliers
✅ Full access to iCreate's labs & fabrication facilities
✅ Networking with investors, startups, and industry leaders
✅ Pilot deployment opportunities & public showcases

All program benefits are fully sponsored (worth ₹500K), including lodging
and boarding.

The first cohort is exclusively for *robotics *startups and innovators,
especially those working on solutions in areas such as autonomous mobility,
underwater systems, vertical climbing robots, snake bots for search &
rescue, and more.

*Program Duration: *01 – 31 July 2025
*Location*: iCreate Campus
*Applications close on*: 15 June 2025

We believe this programme aligns well with the national vision to

Sir/Madam,

Greetings from AICTE!

As you aware that “Study Webs of Active Learning for Young Aspiring Minds”
(SWAYAM) is an initiative under the Ministry of Education, Government of
India, designed to provide quality education to all, in line with the three
cardinal principles of the National Education Policy –access, equity, and
quality. SWAYAM is a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) platform aimed
at democratizing education, particularly for those unable to join the
mainstream knowledge  economy due to various barriers.

Mr. Suraj Kr. Maurya, Training Officer, NIOS, one of the ten National
Coordinators of SWAYAM across India, has conducted a research study on
“SWAYAM &amp; SWAYAM Plus: Catalysts for Inclusive Education in India” and
has formulated a bilingual Questionnaire along with a QR Code  as per  his
letter No. F-82-20/2025/NIOS/CBC/SWAYAM, dated 12.03.2025 (attached for
ready reference).

You are requested to please disseminate the above bilingual Questionnaire
among all faculty, students, learners and others concerned to scan the QR
Code of the bilingual questionnaire and send their feedback to email:

encouraging prospective students to apply. If you could kindly encourage

programs' growth.

It is important that there is no confusion in completing this task, and the
information should be shared widely.

Once you have shared the email, kindly update Bhaskar Sir and me via email,
including the list of groups to whom you have sent the information. Give
this task a priority and complete it by 12:00 pm tomorrow.

Respected Sir/Madam,

Crossword-solving is a powerful cognitive exercise that enhances analytical
thinking, decision-making, memory, concentration, and creativity. It
strengthens problem-solving abilities, fosters a competitive spirit, and
expands vocabulary—skills essential for academic and professional success.

To further promote this engaging and intellectually stimulating activity in
higher education institutions, AICTE, Extra-C, IIM Mumbai, and IIT Madras
have collaborated under an MoU signed on May 21, 2024. As part of this
initiative, the *National Inter-College Crossword Expedition (NICE-25)* is
being organized.

The competition, scheduled between *May and August 2025*, will follow a
hybrid format—online preliminary rounds leading to offline zonal and
national finals. This event provides students with an opportunity to
sharpen their minds while competing on a national platform.

*Attached are the competition guidelines, format, and tentative schedule. *The
MoU can be accessed on the AICTE website. We invite your esteemed
institution to encourage participation in this unique and enriching
challenge https://nice.crypticsingh.com

As a subject teacher, we would like to share insights from the recent
*Continuous
Internal Evaluation (CIE)* conducted for the subject *CEUC102 – Programming
with C++* in the 2nd semester. The evaluation was designed using a
*Problem-Based
Assessment (PBA) evaluation pedagogy* aligned with *Bloom’s Taxonomy*. The
attached report provides a detailed analysis of the outcomes.
*This evaluation methodology emphasized problem-solving, critical thinking,
and application of concepts, rather than rote memorization.*
*The feedback was also collected from you after conducting a CIE and you
expressed a positive perception of this evaluation pedagogy.* You recognize
the relevance of these problem-solving exercises to real-world programming
tasks and appreciate how such assessments prepare them for future
challenges. This is particularly encouraging as you are only in the 2nd
semester, and early exposure to problem-based learning will make them
mature and confident problem solvers in the coming years.

In today’s era of GenAI/LLMs, the ability to think critically, solve
complex problems, and apply concepts creatively is the key to success.
Through this pedagogical approach, we are equipping you with the skills
necessary to thrive in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.

*Attached is the evaluation analysis report for your reference. You are
requested to go through it.*

Thank you.

Share any previous experience you have gained until now.


I have actively engaged with academic and extracurricular communities by  
joining clubs like Quantix: The Quant And Consulting Club and the Ramanujan  
Society of Research (RaSoR) at IITM, which exposed me to analytical  
discussions and innovative thinking in economics and business. I  
volunteered at AWS SCD last semester (September 2024), where I developed  
teamwork and communication skills. In addition to that, my active  
participation in several school literary events has helped me refine my  
writing and creative expression.


What qualities do you possess that would make you a suitable candidate for  
this role? *


I posses both, interest and passion for literature and economics, making me  
a strong candidate for this role. My love for literature is evident in my  
habits of journaling, avid reading, and even dabbling in poetry, all of  
which have helped me develop a distinctive narrative style. Experiences  
like representing my school at literary events, along with active  
participation in academic clubs and volunteer work, have further refined my  
ability to break down complex ideas into engaging, clear content. These  
qualities make me a natural fit for a role that values both creativity and  
precision.


Why do you want to join ARTHYANTRA? *


I'm excited to join ARTHYANTRA because it offers a hands-on opportunity to  
immerse myself in the unique blend of economics, entrepreneurship, and tech  
innovation. As someone passionate about crafting compelling narratives, I'm  
eager to leverage my creative communication skills to capture the club's  
essence. I view this club as a great opportunity for valuable exposure and  
growth alongside like-minded peers.


Do you want to share anything else you think would be helpful for us to  
know about you?


In addition to my active interests in literature and its diverse  
expressions, I am currently pursuing a dual degree in BTech Computer  
Science (CHARUSAT, on campus) and BS in Data Science & Application (IIT  
Madras, online program). This academic journey not only strengthens my  
technical foundation but also enriches my perspective on innovative  
problem-solving and content creation. I believe this unique combination of  
technical skills will allow me to contribute effectively to ARTHYANTRA's  
mission.


Thank you for filling out this form. We will notify you for your respective  
interviews.

students with ample opportunities to engage in Artificial Intelligence and
other emerging technology-based solution- oriented projects. Moreover,
winning teams will not only receive cash prizes but also invaluable
mentorship support from nodal officers of government departments and
benefits from education department of Government of Gujarat, further
encouraging their pursuit of innovation and excellence.

We request all students from your institute to actively participate in 6th

Dear CHARUSAT Family Members,



""The aim of art is to represent not the outward appearance of things but
their inward significance.” – Aristotle



We are delighted to inform you that the Faculty of Humanities, in
collaboration with Indukaka Ipcowala Institute of Management, CHARUSAT is
hosting a unique and enriching Pichhwai Art Workshop, scheduled for March
1, 2025. The workshop will be held in the afternoon slot, providing an
excellent opportunity to explore and engage with this traditional form of
Indian art. *Further, this workshop also aims at promoting Indian arts and
culture proliferated under NEP 2020*.



The ancient painting technique known as Pichhwai art, which originated in
Nathdwara, Rajasthan, some 400 years ago, is intricately linked to the
area's religious legacy. The background of Lord Shrinathji, a venerated
embodiment of Lord Shri Krishna, has long been decorated with these
paintings, which originated at the Nathdwara temple. The themes mostly
centre on events from Lord Shri Krishna's early childhood, which depict his
favourite festivals, pastimes, and seasonal festivities.In addition to
their traditional function as sacred temple hangings, Pichhwai paintings

It is worth noting that this significant task was *completed within just
three weeks*, resulting in Phase 1 (Version 1.0) of the portal. Their
efforts have culminated in a user-friendly and efficient platform that will
benefit the entire institution. This accomplishment is a testament to the
hard work and dedication of our students.

*Let us all take a moment to applaud Dhairya and Priyanshu for their
outstanding accomplishment and be inspired by their dedication.*

We would like to acknowledge and express our gratitude to Dr. Amit Nayak

Dear Secretaries/Directors (Higher & Technical Education)

(All States/UTs in the country)

Greetings from AICTE!

As you know, Yuva Sangam is a key initiative under the Ek Bharat Shreshtha
Bharat (EBSB) program, launched by the Hon'ble Prime Minister of India.
This flagship program facilitates exposure tours for youth primarily
students from Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) to experience diverse
cultures and achievements across different states. Through these exchanges,
we aim to foster national integration and understanding among young people.

Yuva Sangam not only emphasizes cultural exchange but also includes
activities designed to enhance leadership, sports, and soft skills.
Participants will engage in workshops on communication and teamwork, take
part in sports events organized by SAI, and have the chance to interact
with VVIPs and notable personalities from the host state.

The success of previous Yuva Sangam phases underscores the vital role of
youth in building connections across communities. This initiative has
positively impacted the lives of thousands, contributing to a more united
and inclusive India.

I request you to kindly direct *all institutions* imparting higher and
technical education (UG, PG, doctoral etc.) under your State/UT to advise
and motivate their students to register for Yuva Sangam Phase-5, an
enriching student exchange program under EBSB.

Registration is open from *October 10, 2024* to *October 21, 2024* and can
be completed online at https://ebsb.aicte-india.org/.

Please find attached a document with strategies to inspire student
registrations for Yuva Sangam.

Thank you for your support.

*Gentle Reminder!*

Dear Vice Chancellor/Director/Principal/ Dean,
Greetings from AICTE!

As you know, Yuva Sangam is a key initiative under the Ek Bharat Shreshtha
Bharat (EBSB) program, launched by the Hon'ble Prime Minister of India.
This flagship program facilitates exposure tours for youth primarily
students from Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) to experience diverse
cultures and achievements across different states. Through these exchanges,
we aim to foster national integration and understanding among young people.

Yuva Sangam not only emphasizes cultural exchange but also includes
activities designed to enhance leadership, sports, and soft skills.
Participants will engage in workshops on communication and teamwork, take
part in sports events organized by SAI, and have the chance to interact
with VVIPs and notable personalities from the host state.

The success of previous Yuva Sangam phases underscores the vital role of
youth in building connections across communities. This initiative has
positively impacted the lives of thousands, contributing to a more united
and inclusive India.

I encourage you to motivate your students to register for Yuva Sangam
Phase-5, an enriching student exchange program under EBSB.

Registration is open from *October 10, 2024* to *October 21, 2024* and can
be completed online at https://ebsb.aicte-india.org/.

Please find attached a document with strategies to inspire student
registrations for Yuva Sangam.

Thank you for your support.

quiz. If your name is marked in the red column, it means you were not
present for the quiz.

Additionally, some students submitted the quiz from two different accounts.
This time, we will consider it a mistake, but in the future, if this
happens again, *neither submission will be accepted*. For now, we have
counted the marks from the first submission recorded in our system.
