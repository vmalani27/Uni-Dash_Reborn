contribution could significantly strengthen the quality of our dataset. As
a token of appreciation, all contributors will be *acknowledged in our
final research presentation/report*.

 purposes*.

·        We are only interested in academic/informational emails, *not
personal content*.

If you're willing to contribute or have any questions, feel free to reach

CHARUSAT is excited to invite your creative suggestions for *naming our
Multi-Utility Complex.*
The facility is a versatile space for CSIC, CIVF, HRDC, COE, IT Cell, IQAC,
conference rooms, paperless exam halls, an exam control room, and
multitudes of related services. It is designed to cater to the diverse
needs of CHARUSAT's unique initiatives and will play a pivotal role in
enhancing the overall campus experience.


*Criteria for Nomenclature:*

Hi Dr. Priteshkumar,

Amidst the hype surrounding AI-driven cyber threats, what's actually
happening in the wild?

In our upcoming webinar, Adversarial misuse of generative AI: Analysis
beyond the hype
<https://go.cloudplatformonline.com/dc/j-0ZLuKiroz5jBuK2yHK5CJ6ILCpYkKSM2bjwsh0ZRMQWGeonCIIqpEhYE0ycwQp5zliZX7ciSPAjlpccRbKFqvx5lx-Jyj_SUG898ZDn477QCReC6HR4r3n13FDkUkBuVBY1NouHkxwjjD3Z11ExZi4XAg2R5ylNZo1sYxqU0BISMFjoMyNmFbCHqs4pV3KL5G9jKpk9DHcMjxeZbEvB4GZEiKCupnZ64lI0qVNif3NjQuidsj0p5raJ14UR3pQLLi0e0PqYZJjRAvjef8Lm3x-5Qg-T6MitLrLnYBeCWh4HBifAo-rPyA2-Aak5cG7/ODA4LUdKVy0zMTQAAAGaKUvWtr6AASl06eicAURpSlDiyESFNOO01MWKQNcz8ob0uCysvXvBsj0UTstrZr3yVX0jnZI=>,
Google Threat Intelligence experts move beyond theoretical discussions of
abuse of AI, drawing on real-world observations of how government-backed
threat actors have attempted to misuse Google’s AI-powered assistant Gemini
for cyber attacks and information operations.

Our goal is to shed light on these activities with security professionals
to raise awareness and enable stronger protections for all.

*Topics covered include:*

Dear Students,
Watching your uploaded video of the cleanliness drive today, I truly  
appreciate the sincere efforts and dedication shown by you all during the

healthy environment and making people aware of it.

Keep up this positive spirit — such actions go a long way in inspiring  
others and making a real difference!

Dear students,

*EC-Council has launched Hackerverse **Capture the Flag (CTF) challenge**.
Find the details below and register using your CHARUSAT email id for the
same.*

Hackerverse is a global cybersecurity competition ecosystem designed by
EC-Council to support and advance the cybersecurity community worldwide.
Rooted in EC-Council’s longstanding commitment to empowering cybersecurity
professionals worldwide, Hackerverse provides a competitive arena for
individuals across all proficiency levels to demonstrate their skills
through rigorous, gamified *Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges*.

Hackerverse was officially unveiled at Hacker Halted 2022, EC-Council’s
annual cybersecurity conference that unites ethical hackers, security
professionals, and industry leaders from across the globe. A platform for
thought leadership and technical exchange, Hacker Halted serves as a
convergence point for innovation, research, and discourse on emerging cyber
threats and defense strategies.

Hackerverse has helped EC-Council to broaden its impact, transitioning from
localized cybersecurity competitions to a truly global competitive
platform. *Through Hackerverse CTF, a year-long, free-to-enter Capture the
Flag (CTF) challenge on Hackerverse, cybersecurity professionals and
enthusiasts from around the world can now test their skills on a much
larger stage. *The competition features a dynamic scoring system that
rewards participants for speed and precision, reflecting the high-stakes
nature of cybersecurity. *With over $100,000 in prizes, it represents
EC-Council’s commitment to supporting and rewarding cybersecurity talent
worldwide.*

As cyber threats continue to evolve, Hackerverse remains a dynamic proving
ground, ensuring that the next generation of cybersecurity professionals is
prepared to meet the challenges of an increasingly complex digital
landscape.

Hackerverse is a global cybersecurity competition ecosystem designed by
EC-Council to support and advance the cybersecurity community worldwide.
Rooted in EC-Council’s longstanding commitment to empowering cybersecurity
professionals worldwide, Hackerverse provides a competitive arena for
individuals across all proficiency levels to demonstrate their skills
through rigorous, gamified *Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges*.

Hackerverse was officially unveiled at Hacker Halted 2022, EC-Council’s
annual cybersecurity conference that unites ethical hackers, security
professionals, and industry leaders from across the globe. A platform for
thought leadership and technical exchange, Hacker Halted serves as a
convergence point for innovation, research, and discourse on emerging cyber
threats and defense strategies.

Hackerverse has helped EC-Council to broaden its impact, transitioning from
localized cybersecurity competitions to a truly global competitive
platform. *Through Hackerverse CTF, a year-long, free-to-enter Capture the
Flag (CTF) challenge on Hackerverse, cybersecurity professionals and
enthusiasts from around the world can now test their skills on a much
larger stage. *The competition features a dynamic scoring system that
rewards participants for speed and precision, reflecting the high-stakes
nature of cybersecurity. *With over $100,000 in prizes, it represents
EC-Council’s commitment to supporting and rewarding cybersecurity talent
worldwide.*

As cyber threats continue to evolve, Hackerverse remains a dynamic proving
ground, ensuring that the next generation of cybersecurity professionals is
prepared to meet the challenges of an increasingly complex digital
landscape.

Respected Sir/Madam,

Crossword-solving is a powerful cognitive exercise that enhances analytical
thinking, decision-making, memory, concentration, and creativity. It
strengthens problem-solving abilities, fosters a competitive spirit, and
expands vocabulary—skills essential for academic and professional success.

To further promote this engaging and intellectually stimulating activity in
higher education institutions, AICTE, Extra-C, IIM Mumbai, and IIT Madras
have collaborated under an MoU signed on May 21, 2024. As part of this
initiative, the *National Inter-College Crossword Expedition (NICE-25)* is
being organized.

The competition, scheduled between *May and August 2025*, will follow a
hybrid format—online preliminary rounds leading to offline zonal and
national finals. This event provides students with an opportunity to
sharpen their minds while competing on a national platform.

*Attached are the competition guidelines, format, and tentative schedule. *The
MoU can be accessed on the AICTE website. We invite your esteemed
institution to encourage participation in this unique and enriching
challenge https://nice.crypticsingh.com

Dear,

The Education Department, Gujarat has been doing persistent efforts to
institutionalize the Innovation & Startup Ecosystem in the State through

nurturing student Start-ups in the State, second edition of Student
Start-up and Innovation Policy (SSIP 2.0) was launched on 05 January 2022.

Under the Policy, various flagship initiatives have been envisaged through
which youth can get adequate opportunities to harness their creative
potential. We have pioneered various Open Innovation Programmes like

The 6th Edition *of “Smart Gujarat Hackathon” with special focus on
Artificial Intelligence* will be a step forward towards building smart and
sustainable solutions to complex challenges. In this edition of hackathon

statements. Challenges from various departments of the State Government,
Public Sector Undertakings, Municipal Corporations, District Collectorate,
District Panchayats and industries will be broadcasted to students across
universities, institutes, and schools.

The program will feature problem statements from various sectors providing
students with ample opportunities to engage in *Artificial Intelligence and
other emerging technology-based solution- oriented *projects. Moreover,
winning teams will not only receive cash prizes but also invaluable
mentorship support from nodal officers of government departments and
benefits from education department of Government of Gujarat, further
encouraging their pursuit of innovation and excellence.

We request all students from your institute to actively participate in 6th
edition of “Smart Gujarat Hackathon”. This event presents a fantastic
opportunity for students to showcase their problem-solving skills and
innovative thinking. To get more details and further update regarding

Subject: Participation of Students, Teachers, and Administrators in the
‘Ask Our Expert’ Programme on NAD-ABC on November 8, 2024 -Regarding


Dear Madam/Sir,
Greetings from All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) ..!

We are pleased to inform you that the Ministry of Electronics and
Information Technology (MeitY) is organizing a *online live talk show *on
the *Academic Bank of Credits(ABC)*, a project of the Ministry of Education
(MoE) aimed at providing a seamless, student-centric learning experience
while enhancing the ease of credit accumulation and transfer for students
across institutions.

As part of the outreach efforts under the Digital India Initiative, MeitY
is hosting the 3rd episode of the “Ask Our Expert Programme” focused on
ABC-NAD. This programme will be held *on November 8, 2024, starting at 1 PM
onwards*. *The live talk show will be conducted by experts from the
government, featuring focused discussions aimed at equipping faculty,
students, and administrators from various Academic Institutions (AIs) with
essential knowledge about the benefits, implementation process, and
opportunities associated with the ABC*.Given the role that these
stakeholders play in the success of the Academic Bank of Credits, we
earnestly urge you to encourage and facilitate their participation in this
session.

The details for joining the webinar are mentioned below:-

·         *Date*: 8th November 2024
·       *  Time*: 1 PM onwards
·         *Platform*: YouTube Official Digital India Channel
·         *Link*: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqIoGwIXjoM

This session will not only deepen the understanding of participants about
ABC but also align them with the Digital India vision for a more connected
and efficient educational ecosystem. The insights shared during this will
empower faculty to effectively leverage ABC, support students in their
academic journeys and help administrators optimize institutional credit
management practices.

We trust that this collaboration will greatly benefit our educational
community, ultimately contributing to a more integrated and accessible
learning environment for all.

For any further assistance, Mr. Gaurav Khare may kindly be contacted at
gaurav.khare1@digitalindia.gov.in.

Thank you for your support in encouraging faculty and students to engage in
the future of e-governance and collaborative technology platforms.

In view of the foregoing,  AICTE requests your institution to share this
information with all the faculty, students, staff, and others, so that they
can benefit from it.
