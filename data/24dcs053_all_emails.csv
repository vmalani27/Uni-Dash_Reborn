Thank you so much for your willingness to support our research project. We
truly appreciate your help in improving the accuracy and effectiveness of
our academic email classification model.

As promised, your data will be used strictly for academic purposes, and
only informational emails will be processed. Your contribution will also be
acknowledged in our final presentation/report.

To make the process simple, we’ve prepared a Google Drive folder containing:

A script that will extract only academic emails from your inbox.

A short instruction video explaining exactly how to run the script safely
and securely.

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PbOQD_oKgAsZ9pWPrY62nWme5xyJr6JD?usp=sharing

The video is inside the same folder, titled “Email Extraction
Instructions.mp4”.


The link to provide the extracted emails is given below

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NNd3t-VRDvEbDpGLDJOCsyBMA1t19Pdz?usp=sharing
Please go through the video before running the script. If you have any
doubts or face any issues at any step, feel free to reach out to us — we're
more than happy to help!

Once again, thank you for contributing to this student-led research
project. Your support means a lot to us!

Dear Students,

It is highly disappointing to note that despite prior communication and
repeated reminders, *only a limited number of students *have reported on
the first official day of the Third Semester, i.e., *23rd June 2025*.

Let us be absolutely clear—*regular classes and laboratory sessions have
commenced as per the academic calendar*, and your absence is viewed as a
serious breach of academic responsibility. This lack of seriousness and
disregard for institutional guidelines will not be tolerated.

All students who have not reported are hereby instructed to join *without
further delay*. Continued absenteeism will result in:

   -

   *Marking of attendance as ‘Absent’ from Day 1 onwards | **Strict
   disciplinary action as per the institute norms*

We expect every student to uphold the discipline, commitment, and integrity
expected from a professional academic environment. No further excuses will
be entertained.

*Report to the institute immediately.*

regards,

Dear All
You are requested to circulate the below email received from i-Create,
Gujarat, to all interested students , faculty for startup and innovations.


Subject: ProtoQuik Launchpad, Cohort 1: Robotics from iCreate

I am reaching out to you to introduce *ProtoQuik Launchpad, Cohort 1*:
*Robotics*, and seeking your help to identify and attract high-potential
teams and innovators. It would be immensely helpful if you could share the
attached outreach material with your network of students, alumni,
faculty-led startups, or affiliated incubation centers. More details are
available in the attached brochure and webpage:
https://protoquik.icreate.org.in/

This one-of-a-kind programme is designed to help students, innovators and
startups bridge the critical *TRL-4 to TRL-7 gap* – often referred to as
the “*Valley of Death*”. Through a *fully sponsored* and intensive
*30-day* journey,
selected participants will gain:
✅ Up to ₹200K prototyping support
✅ Opportunity to pitch for funding from a ₹20 Million pool
✅ Expert-led sessions & one-on-one mentoring
✅ Support to refine your prototype into an MVP
✅ Access to mentors, designers, vendors & suppliers
✅ Full access to iCreate's labs & fabrication facilities
✅ Networking with investors, startups, and industry leaders
✅ Pilot deployment opportunities & public showcases

All program benefits are fully sponsored (worth ₹500K), including lodging
and boarding.

The first cohort is exclusively for *robotics *startups and innovators,
especially those working on solutions in areas such as autonomous mobility,
underwater systems, vertical climbing robots, snake bots for search &
rescue, and more.

*Program Duration: *01 – 31 July 2025
*Location*: iCreate Campus
*Applications close on*: 15 June 2025

We believe this programme aligns well with the national vision to
strengthen India’s Deep Tech and robotics innovation ecosystem. Your

Sir/Madam,

Greetings from AICTE!

As you aware that “Study Webs of Active Learning for Young Aspiring Minds”
(SWAYAM) is an initiative under the Ministry of Education, Government of
India, designed to provide quality education to all, in line with the three
cardinal principles of the National Education Policy –access, equity, and
quality. SWAYAM is a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) platform aimed
at democratizing education, particularly for those unable to join the
mainstream knowledge  economy due to various barriers.

Mr. Suraj Kr. Maurya, Training Officer, NIOS, one of the ten National
Coordinators of SWAYAM across India, has conducted a research study on
“SWAYAM &amp; SWAYAM Plus: Catalysts for Inclusive Education in India” and
has formulated a bilingual Questionnaire along with a QR Code  as per  his
letter No. F-82-20/2025/NIOS/CBC/SWAYAM, dated 12.03.2025 (attached for
ready reference).

You are requested to please disseminate the above bilingual Questionnaire
among all faculty, students, learners and others concerned to scan the QR
Code of the bilingual questionnaire and send their feedback to email:

Concerning the above, this is to bring to your kind attention that after
the successful execution of the two editions of PM-YUVA Mentorship Scheme,
PM-YUVA Mentorship Scheme 3.0 has been launched by the Ministry of
Education, Government of India  * to train young and budding authors  *
(below 30 years of age) for the year 2025-26 with the National Book Trust,
India as the Implementing Agency. The Themes of PM-YUVA 3.0 are:

a.Contribution of Indian Diaspora in Nation Building

b.Indian Knowledge System

c.Makers of Modern India (1950-2025)

The scheme will help to develop a stream of writers who can write on
various facets of India encompassing the past, present and future. Besides,
the scheme will also provide a window to the aspiring youth to articulate
themselves and present a comprehensive outlook of contribution of Indians
across fields in ancient and present times.

The scheme aims to cultivate a new generation of writers who can articulate
the contributions of the Indian diaspora in nation-building, highlighting
their peaceful integration and influence across political, economic, and
socio-cultural spheres. It will also emphasise on the role of the Indian
Knowledge System in preserving historical wisdom, generating new
opportunities, and synthesising indigenous knowledge for national
development.

Through this initiative, young authors will explore the impact of
visionaries in various fields like education, science, economy, social
empowerment, etc. thereby presenting a comprehensive narrative of India's
growth and resilience. Given India’s position as the third-largest book
publishing market, this initiative is a crucial step toward projecting its
intellectual and cultural wealth on the global stage.

An online National Contest is being organised from 11 March 2025 – 10 June
2025 to select the authors under the Scheme. There is a provision for
payment of a Scholarship of Rs.50,000 per month for a period of six months
to be paid to each of the selected 50 authors. National Book Trust, India
will be publishing the books produced by the young authors as part of the
Mentorship Scheme.
* You are requested to disseminate the information pertaining to the Scheme
among the students and other stakeholders to encourage greater
participation in this prestigious scheme. *

Respected Madam/Sir,

*Greetings from AICTE!*

The *National Innovation Challenge for Drone Application & Research (NIDAR)* is
India’s largest national drone innovation challenge hosted by the Ministry
of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) and Drone Federation
India (DFI) under the *SwaYaan* Initiative. SwaYaan is a National
Initiative by MeitY to develop and strengthen India’s UAS/Drone ecosystem,
aligning with the Government’s vision to make India a global drone hub by
2030. The Drone Federation India (DFI) is a non-government, non-profit,
industry-led body representing 550+ drone companies and 5500+ drone pilots
across the country.

With prizes, startup incubation, and industry mentorship, NIDAR inspires
students and researchers from academia to build collaborative
autonomous drones for solving real-world problems in disaster management
and precision agriculture. Through this initiative, participants gain
hands-on experience, industry-relevant skills, and access to career
opportunities in India’s rapidly growing drone sector. NIDAR aims to be a
transformative milestone in shaping India’s future of drone technology and
aerospace innovation.

*Institutions are encouraged to motivate their students & researchers to
register for NIDAR at *https://nidar.org.in

In the interconnected and competitive world today, language skills are not

differentiator.

Humanities* (FoH), CHARUSAT are jointly organizing *30 hrs offline 2 Credit
Certificate Course* titled *""French For All""*, scheduled from 12th May to
30th May, 2025. This program is specially designed for *beginners and
language enthusiasts* who wish to experience the richness and utility of
the French language through engaging, hands-on sessions.


The detailed brochure is attached for your kind reference. We encourage you
to share this opportunity with interested students, colleagues, and anyone
eager to expand their linguistic and professional horizons.


For any further queries, please feel free to contact: *Dr. Vikas Raval* –
+91 94293 56638 or 5135 (intercom).


We look forward to your active participation and support.


Thank you.

New announcement

2CSE1 - B batch Students,

AIM: Design an application for a vehicle rental service that manages  
different types of vehicles such as cars, bikes, and trucks. Each vehicle  
type has a unique way of calculating rental charges based on factors like  
distance travelled, number of days, or load capacity. The system should  
provide a unified interface for displaying vehicle details and computing  
rental costs, allowing flexibility to handle multiple vehicle types through  
a common reference. The program should simulate real-world rental  
operations by allowing users to enter vehicle-specific data, calculate  
charges dynamically, and display a final bill, ensuring that the logic  
adapts correctly depending on the vehicle category chosen by the user.

New announcement

Div-2; Batch-cAIM:
Develop a hospital management system that efficiently handles
information related to both patients and staff. The system should begin by
capturing basic personal information common to all individuals, then diverge
into two specialized branches: one for managing patient-specific data like  
illness
details and treatment charges, and another for handling staff-related
information such as role, department, and salary. A separate component  
should
also handle billing logic for patients and payroll logic for staff. The  
system
should allow entry of complete records, calculation of payment-related  
details,
and display of summaries, simulating real-world administrative operations  
in a
healthcare setting through a structured and logical class relationship.

2CSE1 - C Batch Students,

AIM: Develop a university management system that handles student academic  
records across departments. The system should begin by storing general  
person-related information such as name and ID, then extend to  
student-specific attributes like roll number and enrolled course, and  
finally manage academic details including subject-wise marks, grade  
calculation, and result status. This layered structure should follow a  
logical hierarchy where each level of information builds upon the previous,  
ensuring systematic initialization and access to data. The application  
should include functionality to input complete details, compute overall  
performance, and display a summarized report card, thus simulating  
realistic academic record processing through a well-organized inheritance  
structure.

AIM: Design
an application to manage an online bookstore where each book is categorized
under a specific genre. The system should maintain basic book details like
title, author, price, and stock, while also supporting dynamic addition,
viewing, and removal of books. The categorization should follow a structure
where a derived category class inherits general attributes and behaviors  
from
a base book class. The system must ensure that whenever a book is added,
necessary details are properly initialized, and all records are managed
dynamically to allow real-time updates. Integrate a menu-driven approach to
simulate operations such as adding new books, viewing all books, deleting a
specific book by its title, and filtering books based on genre,  
demonstrating
logical flow and efficient resource handling.

a mini banking system that manages individual customer accounts with proper  
initialization and clean-up of account data. The system should allow users  
to perform core banking operations such as depositing and withdrawing  
money, along with viewing account summaries and current balances. Sensitive  
details like balance and personal information must be securely handled,  
with specific functionalities given limited access for data retrieval.  
Ensure that when an account is created, relevant details are set up  
automatically, and when it is closed, a proper closure message is  
displayed. Implement a menu-driven approach to handle transactions,  
ensuring appropriate checks such as sufficient balance during withdrawals  
and accurate display of account information, emulating real-world banking  
behavior.

spread the word about the program within their personal circles and
networks. Their recommendations and word of mouth can be a powerful tool in
encouraging prospective students to apply. If you could kindly encourage
them to share the details of the program with friends, family, or
acquaintances who may be interested, it would greatly contribute to the
programs' growth.

Please make sure to send the provided email along with all the attachments
of BA English and BLIS program to all Google Classrooms, Teams, Email
groups, and WhatsApp groups where you are /have been involved in teaching.
It is important that there is no confusion in completing this task, and the
information should be shared widely.

Once you have shared the email, kindly update Bhaskar Sir and me via email,
including the list of groups to whom you have sent the information. Give
this task a priority and complete it by 12:00 pm tomorrow.

*Your efforts and support in the admission process will be noted and
appreciated!*

With regards,

Kaushik Trivedi

Respected Sir/Madam,

Crossword-solving is a powerful cognitive exercise that enhances analytical
thinking, decision-making, memory, concentration, and creativity. It
strengthens problem-solving abilities, fosters a competitive spirit, and
expands vocabulary—skills essential for academic and professional success.

To further promote this engaging and intellectually stimulating activity in
higher education institutions, AICTE, Extra-C, IIM Mumbai, and IIT Madras
have collaborated under an MoU signed on May 21, 2024. As part of this
initiative, the *National Inter-College Crossword Expedition (NICE-25)* is
being organized.

The competition, scheduled between *May and August 2025*, will follow a
hybrid format—online preliminary rounds leading to offline zonal and
national finals. This event provides students with an opportunity to
sharpen their minds while competing on a national platform.

*Attached are the competition guidelines, format, and tentative schedule. *The
MoU can be accessed on the AICTE website. We invite your esteemed
institution to encourage participation in this unique and enriching
challenge https://nice.crypticsingh.com

sessions, this week we are organising a webinar on the topic of 'Getting
started with building AI (Artificial Intelligence) Projects and Agents'.
There is *NO FEE* for this session, but *seats are limited* and will be
allocated on a *first-come, first-served basis*.



*Also, since AICTE has declared 2025 as the Year of AI *and since institutions
are actively updating their curricula to* include topics in Artificial
Intelligence. *This series of sessions will help students gain essential
insights into key AI concepts.

EXPERIMENT NO. 7

AIM: Design, implement and verify the operation of the circuit using i.
Multiplexer and ii.
decoder for given Boolean expressions.
SIMULATION SOFTWARE: https://www.digitalelectronicsdeeds.com/downloads.html
APPARATUS: 8 X 1 MUX, 3 to 8 Decoder, OR Gate ICs, Switches, LED,
connecting wires.
THEORY:
(I) Implementation of Function using Multiplexer
Combinational logic circuits can be designed using Multiplexers (MUX).
Standard ICs like 74152
(8:1 MUX), 74150 (16:1 MUX) etc are available in market. Combinational
logic design using
Multiplexer provide many advantages like reduction of IC package count,
simplified logic design,
no requirement of logic expression simplification in the circuit.
Example: Implement the following Boolean function using 8 × 1 MUX
F (A, B, C, D) = Σm (0, 1, 3, 4, 8, 9, 15)

PROCEDURE:
i). Make connections as per logic circuit diagram.
ii). Apply proper input condition and observe the output information of led
on/off.
iii). Apply all possible combinations of input and verify correctness of
circuit output as per truth
tables.
SCREENSHOTS: (Keep your enrolment number in DEEDs as label which can be
seen in
every screenshot)

CSE-DEPSTAR CSUC101-Digital Electronics

(II) Implementation of Function using Decoder
A decoder takes n-input lines and has 2n output lines. These output lines
can provide the minterms
of input variables. Since any Boolean function can be expressed as a sum of
minterms, a decoder
that can generate these minterms along with external OR gates that form
their logical sums, can be
used to form a circuit of any boolean function.
Example, Implement the logic of a full adder, using 3 to 8 decoders and OR
gates.
S(x,y,z) = Σm(1,2,4,7)
C(x,y,z)=Σm(3,5,6,7)

PROCEDURE:
i). Make connections as per logic circuit diagram.
ii). Apply proper input condition and observe the output information of led
on/off.
iii). Apply all possible combinations of input and verify correctness of
circuit output as per truth
tables.

As a subject teacher, we would like to share insights from the recent
*Continuous
Internal Evaluation (CIE)* conducted for the subject *CEUC102 – Programming
with C++* in the 2nd semester. The evaluation was designed using a
*Problem-Based
Assessment (PBA) evaluation pedagogy* aligned with *Bloom’s Taxonomy*. The
attached report provides a detailed analysis of the outcomes.
*This evaluation methodology emphasized problem-solving, critical thinking,
and application of concepts, rather than rote memorization.*
*The feedback was also collected from you after conducting a CIE and you
expressed a positive perception of this evaluation pedagogy.* You recognize
the relevance of these problem-solving exercises to real-world programming
tasks and appreciate how such assessments prepare them for future
challenges. This is particularly encouraging as you are only in the 2nd
semester, and early exposure to problem-based learning will make them
mature and confident problem solvers in the coming years.

In today’s era of GenAI/LLMs, the ability to think critically, solve
complex problems, and apply concepts creatively is the key to success.
Through this pedagogical approach, we are equipping you with the skills
necessary to thrive in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.

*Attached is the evaluation analysis report for your reference. You are
requested to go through it.*

Thank you.

students with ample opportunities to engage in Artificial Intelligence and
other emerging technology-based solution- oriented projects. Moreover,
winning teams will not only receive cash prizes but also invaluable
mentorship support from nodal officers of government departments and
benefits from education department of Government of Gujarat, further
encouraging their pursuit of innovation and excellence.

We request all students from your institute to actively participate in 6th

Dear CHARUSAT Family Members,



""The aim of art is to represent not the outward appearance of things but
their inward significance.” – Aristotle



We are delighted to inform you that the Faculty of Humanities, in
collaboration with Indukaka Ipcowala Institute of Management, CHARUSAT is
hosting a unique and enriching Pichhwai Art Workshop, scheduled for March
1, 2025. The workshop will be held in the afternoon slot, providing an
excellent opportunity to explore and engage with this traditional form of
Indian art. *Further, this workshop also aims at promoting Indian arts and
culture proliferated under NEP 2020*.



The ancient painting technique known as Pichhwai art, which originated in
Nathdwara, Rajasthan, some 400 years ago, is intricately linked to the
area's religious legacy. The background of Lord Shrinathji, a venerated
embodiment of Lord Shri Krishna, has long been decorated with these
paintings, which originated at the Nathdwara temple. The themes mostly
centre on events from Lord Shri Krishna's early childhood, which depict his
favourite festivals, pastimes, and seasonal festivities.In addition to
their traditional function as sacred temple hangings, Pichhwai paintings
have become more and more popular as home decor, interiors for museums, and
art galleries. Beyond paintings, the motifs and intricate designs are now
replicated on textiles, cushion covers, and carpets, preserving the
artistic legacy in contemporary decor.



We have invited upcoming and enthusiastic artists, Shri Mahesh Rabari and
Ms. Muskan Mehta. The artists conducting the Pichhwai Art Workshop are
highly skilled practitioners dedicated to preserving and promoting this
traditional art form. They have mastered the intricate techniques and
symbolism of Pichhwai Art, bringing its rich heritage to life.



*Workshop details are:*

Subject: Alert Regarding Fraudulent Job Appointment Scams Using AICTE and
MOE Identities.

It has come to the attention of the All India Council for Technical
Education (AICTE) that fraudulent activities are being conducted wherein
fake job appointment letters and related communications are issued in the
name of AICTE and Ministry of Education (MOE) officers. These
communications are sent from counterfeit email addresses resembling
official domains, misleading individuals into believing they have been
offered employment opportunities. It is for your information that the All
India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) uses only its own domain
as  aicte-india.org
<http://elink.aicte-india.org/vtrack?clientid=183745&ul=BlQGB0RTThURWg1SUBJXCBtVBkJAFgdAdVZdAhEXSgBGGQMCHQ9dTUweCA==&ml=A1kBBgkfAhlSB1VN&sl=cx1ySm0wTjYuZx9UVQtYDxtQClFHB0tbW1FcAk0NSwZOBw==&pp=0&ga=utm_source%3DNetcore%26utm_campaign%3DAlert%2BRegarding%2BFraudulent%26utm_medium%3DEmail%26utm_content%3D&fl=WRVFRgJMHQQKUBdUFAtYAFxQTV1BBUk=&ext=>
 for any communication.
Key points of Concern:
1. Nature Of Fraud: Fraudsters are impersonating AICTE and MOE officials
and issuing fraudulent job offers,
2. Tactics Used: Use Of fake email addresses and forged documents to appear
legitimate.
3, Impact: Such scams tarnish the reputation Of AICTE and MOE while
exploiting unsuspecting individuals.
Actions to be Taken by Institutions:

fraudulent activity and advise them to be cautious when dealing with
unsolicited job offers.
2.  Verification Protocol: Encourage individuals to verify the authenticity
of any job-related communication purportedly from AICTE or MOE by
contacting official channels.
3.  Report Suspicious Activity: Direct any instances of fraudulent
communication to the AICTE or the Cyber Crime Division immediately,
4.  Publish Notifications: Kindly display this circular on notice boards
and circulate it widely among your institution's community.

*Sunday*, and we will select 100 students from this round.

Dear Secretaries/Directors (Higher & Technical Education)

(All States/UTs in the country)

Greetings from AICTE!

As you know, Yuva Sangam is a key initiative under the Ek Bharat Shreshtha
Bharat (EBSB) program, launched by the Hon'ble Prime Minister of India.
This flagship program facilitates exposure tours for youth primarily
students from Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) to experience diverse
cultures and achievements across different states. Through these exchanges,
we aim to foster national integration and understanding among young people.

Yuva Sangam not only emphasizes cultural exchange but also includes
activities designed to enhance leadership, sports, and soft skills.
Participants will engage in workshops on communication and teamwork, take
part in sports events organized by SAI, and have the chance to interact
with VVIPs and notable personalities from the host state.

The success of previous Yuva Sangam phases underscores the vital role of
youth in building connections across communities. This initiative has
positively impacted the lives of thousands, contributing to a more united
and inclusive India.

I request you to kindly direct *all institutions* imparting higher and
technical education (UG, PG, doctoral etc.) under your State/UT to advise
and motivate their students to register for Yuva Sangam Phase-5, an
enriching student exchange program under EBSB.

Registration is open from *October 10, 2024* to *October 21, 2024* and can
be completed online at https://ebsb.aicte-india.org/.

Please find attached a document with strategies to inspire student
registrations for Yuva Sangam.

Thank you for your support.

Dear Vice Chancellor/Director/Principal/ Dean,

Greetings from AICTE!

As you know, Yuva Sangam is a key initiative under the Ek Bharat Shreshtha
Bharat (EBSB) program, launched by the Hon'ble Prime Minister of India.
This flagship program facilitates exposure tours for youth primarily
students from Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) to experience diverse
cultures and achievements across different states. Through these exchanges,
we aim to foster national integration and understanding among young people.

Yuva Sangam not only emphasizes cultural exchange but also includes
activities designed to enhance leadership, sports, and soft skills.
Participants will engage in workshops on communication and teamwork, take
part in sports events organized by SAI, and have the chance to interact
with VVIPs and notable personalities from the host state.

The success of previous Yuva Sangam phases underscores the vital role of
youth in building connections across communities. This initiative has
positively impacted the lives of thousands, contributing to a more united
and inclusive India.

I encourage you to motivate your students to register for Yuva Sangam
Phase-5, an enriching student exchange program under EBSB.

Registration is open from *October 10, 2024* to *October 21, 2024* and can
be completed online at https://ebsb.aicte-india.org/.

Please find attached a document with strategies to inspire student
registrations for Yuva Sangam.
