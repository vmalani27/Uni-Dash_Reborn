Hey, we have some exciting news:

-----------------------------------
Lovable is free to use this weekend
-----------------------------------

Lovable is free for everyone over this weekend, starting now until Sunday 15th of June 23:59 CET!

During this time, credits will not be deducted when making prompts.

There might be rate limits during high demand, where paid users get prioritized access.

Start building for free: lovable.dev ( https://lovable.dev/ )

---------------
The AI Showdown
---------------

The reason Lovable is free this weekend is because we've partnered with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google to host The AI Showdown: a public comparison of the world’s leading AI models.

During The AI Showdown, for the first time, you will be able to easily switch what AI model to power Lovable.

During the weekend we're hosting two competitions:

* Content challenge ($25,000 prize): Create the best content focused on comparing the capabilities of the models inside Lovable.
* Build challenge ($40,000 prize): A build challenge to showcase what each model can create inside Lovable.

You can participate and follow the live model comparison dashboard at: aishowdown.lovable.app ( https://aishowdown.lovable.app/ )

Learn more about The AI Showdown here ( https://x.com/lovable_dev/status/1933643500727222322 ).

1. Learn how to build your own full-stack JavaScript apps. freeCodeCamp just published a comprehensive course on the popular MERN Stack. MERN stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. These are the key tools that a lot of modern web apps use, including freeCodeCamp's platform itself. You'll learn how to build your user interface, handle data routing, and even rate-limit your back end API – so you can stop your app from getting overwhelmed by all those bots out there that are scraping the web for LLM training data. (4 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-mern-stack-in-2025/

2. Learn MLOps by building your own system that can run sentiment analysis on YouTube videos. The emerging field of ML Ops is a hybrid of Machine Learning and System Administration (AKA Ops). This comprehensive course will give you a solid project-oriented intro to MLOps. You'll learn about Data Preprocessing, AI Model Benchmarking, Hyperparameter Tuning, Ensemble Techniques and more. (3 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-mlops-by-creating-a-youtube-sentiment-analyzer/

3. On this week's freeCodeCamp podcast, I interview former CTO and prolific programming teacher Hitesh Choudhary. He shares lessons he's learned from personally mentoring dozens of software engineers over the years. He also talks about India's higher education system. And he gives tons of tips for managing your time as a developer. I had a blast learning from Hitesh and I think you will, too. (1 hour watch or listen in your favorite podcast app): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/from-electrical-engineering-student-to-cto-with-hitesh-choudhary-podcast-175/

4. freeCodeCamp published a new handbook on the emerging architecture paradigm of Micro Frontends. You'll learn why this approach is gaining so much steam among software engineers. This handbook will teach you all about Module Federation, Cross-Window Messaging, the Shadow DOM, and more. (full-length handbook): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/complete-micro-frontends-guide/

5. And we published a handbook on Apple's code signing process. If you want to publish mobile apps in the Apple store, this handbook is a real lifesaver. It would have saved freeCodeCamp's team a ton of time when we were publishing the freeCodeCamp iOS app. We're going to publish a lot more hyper-specific handbooks like this in the future to make developers' lives a bit easier. Bookmark this and you can come back to it when you're ready to publish your first app. (full-length handbook): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/apple-code-signing-handbook/

I've had a great time learning so much this week, and I hope you're learning a ton, too. The world is changing fast – both for better and for worse. It's perhaps more important than ever that you and I be able to adapt to all these changes. The freeCodeCamp community has got your back, and we're going to help you keep up with these new developments. I encourage you to return the favor by supporting our charity and our mission: https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate

Quote of the Week: 
“You will not get opportunities unless you prove yourself first. And for proving yourself, there is no hiring manager coming to your door and saying, ‘Hey, please build something for me.’ You have to prove it by contributing to open source.” — Software Engineer and programming teacher Hitesh Choudhary, on this week's freeCodeCamp podcast

Until next week, happy coding.

We hope you're doing well.

We are a group of students working on a research project focused on
analyzing CHARUSAT student inbox data to train a machine learning model
that can automatically classify academic emails — such as faculty

opportunities.

We are reaching out to a few *handpicked students*, and we believe your
contribution could significantly strengthen the quality of our dataset. As
a token of appreciation, all contributors will be *acknowledged in our
final research presentation/report*.

Please rest assured:

·       Your data will be used *strictly for academic and research
 purposes*.

·        We are only interested in academic/informational emails, *not
personal content*.

·        *No data will be collected without your clear consent*, and we
will *explain the data extraction process in detail* if you agree to help.

If you're willing to contribute or have any questions, feel free to reach
out. We truly appreciate your support in helping make this student-led
research a success!

Over the years we&#39;ve published hundreds of courses on,"Here are this week's five freeCodeCamp resources that are worth your time:

1. freeCodeCamp just published our first-ever chemistry course. Over the years we've published hundreds of courses on math and computer science, and we're gradually adding other academic subjects as well. This is an excellent starting point for beginners, and a great refresher for folks who want to get back into learning chemistry. Chad, the instructor, has taught chemistry for more than 15 years. He'll teach you the absolute basics of matter, chemical bonding, and scientific notation. Then you'll dive into more intermediate topics like thermodynamics, kinetics, and electrochemistry. (35 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/general-chemistry-college-course/

2. Learn low-level game development by building your own Candy Crush-style match-3 video game using the C programming language. That's right – instead of using a powerful game engine like Unreal or Unity 3D, you're going to use some of the most fundamental tools imaginable. You'll implement the core game logic, detect player input, and even add bursts of animation using the Raylib graphics library. This is a fun way to spend an afternoon while getting reps with the world's most widely run language. (1 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/c-game-development-with-raylib/

3. On this week's podcast, I interview software engineer and O'reilly programming book author Joe Attardi about the many changes he's seen during his 21 years in industry. He talks about how AI tools are changing development, and how he thinks devs with a strong foundation in computer science are best positioned to fully leverage these tools. Joe's one chill, humble dude. I had a blast learning from him. And I think you will, too. (1 hour watch or listen in your favorite podcast app): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-survive-in-tech-when-everythings-changing-w-21-year-veteran-dev-joe-attardi-podcast-174/

4. freeCodeCamp published a couple handbooks this week, too. This first one will teach you how to build your own AI agents using open source tools like LangChain and LangGraph. You'll learn about automation workflows, agent loops, multi-agent collaboration, and more. (full-length handbook): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-open-source-llm-agent-handbook/

5. And this second handbook will take you on a deep dive into the world of Front End Monitoring. You'll learn how to collect performance data, error data, user behavior data, then make sense of these insights through modern reporting tools. If you're serious about leveling up your full stack development skills, I think you'll find this to be well worth reading. (full-length handbook): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-front-end-monitoring-handbook/

The freeCodeCamp community is shipping so many things this month, including tons of new interactive React curriculum coursework. We're working hard to teach you core skills alongside emerging tools. You can get involved by joining the 11,321 kind folks who support our charity's mission each month: https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate

Quote of the Week: “Computer Science fundamentals are more important than ever. As a software engineer, I want to understand things. I don’t like just taking stuff at face value. I want to know why it works and what’s going on behind the scenes.” —  21-year industry veteran Joe Attardi on this week's freeCodeCamp podcast

Until next week, happy coding.

******************
Lovable Update —
June 4th
******************

Hey,

In the last 2 weeks we've done a bunch of improvements to Lovable!

This is what's new:

---------------
Security Review
---------------

Security Review

Our new security reviewer uses AI to analyze your app for security vulnerabilities and recommends a plan to address them.

--------------------------------------
Warnings if you put an API key in chat
--------------------------------------

Warnings if you put an API key in chat

Previously, people would sometimes ask Lovable to hardcode API secrets into their app, which posed a major security risk as those secrets could be easily leaked. We now block around 1200 private API keys from being directly inserted in code per day.

All API keys should be stored as a secret in Supabase via our special in-chat form.

----------------------------------
Filtering of own and team projects
----------------------------------

Filtering of own and team projects

Improved project discoverability with new filtering options to easily find and manage your projects.

------------------------------------
Categorization of community projects
------------------------------------

Categorization of community projects

Categorization to community projects to make it easier to discover projects by the community.

You can now also see the amount of remixes each project has.

------------------------
Visualize back-end flows
------------------------

Visualize back-end flows

Chat mode can now render Mermaid diagrams to help visualize your app's back-end logic and structure (ask for it to chart things to trigger this).

------------------
Other Improvements
------------------

* Added voice mode functionality - simply speak your ideas and have them automatically converted to text for faster development.
* Auto-configure redirect URLs for Supabase Auth integration - no more manual configuration needed for a more seamless authentication setup.
* Added in-product feedback system - click the thumbs down button when edits cause issues to help us improve Lovable's AI for everyone.
* Introduced smart nudges to guide you to Chat Mode when debugging issues that need conversational help.

Tuesday, June 3, 2025


May was an a-may-zing month for updates at Replit.

... Ok, I’ll show myself out. If this is the last email you get from me, that 
pun finally did me in.

But seriously, it was a big month. We shipped a ton of features you won’t want 
to miss. Check them out and let us know what you think.

May's updates include:


 * Sonnet 4.0 in Agent: We're shipping the latest and greatest models on day-1
 * Safe vibe coding: Security Scan, checkpoint improvements, Replit Auth
 * New integrations: Build with Notion, PayPal, and Google Analytics
 * Visual edits: Bringing you a new, improved editing experience

and much, much more!




🆕 Sonnet 4 in Agent



Replit Agent is now powered by Claude Sonnet 4.0.

 We partnered with Anthropic to bring you the latest & greatest Sonnet the 
same day as the release. You'll notice improved Agent performance and speed. ✌️


🔒Safe Vibe Coding


 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o76diiNCJwA>

This month, we dialed in safety.

 We now prevent accidental pasting of API keys into Agent chat and warn about 
sensitive data. We've also introduced comprehensiveSecurity Scans 
<https://docs.replit.com/replit-workspace/workspace-features/security-scanner#security-scanner>
 for your entire Agent project to find and report potential vulnerabilities in 
realtime thanks to Semgrep.

 Last, but definitely not least, Auth 
<https://docs.replit.com/replit-workspace/replit-auth#replit-auth> is out for 
all users to quickly add log-in to your apps, securely. Check out the launch 
video above for all the deets 🔐


🤝 Notion + Replit


 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOYqTONf07o>

Our new Notion integration is live! You can now build Apps with Replit that 
push or pull data from Notion.

That means you can build a completely customized blog with Notion pages as 
data or a workout tracker that outputs data to a Notion DB.

 You can dive-in with our interactive tutorial above. You can also follow 
along in our docshere 
<https://docs.replit.com/tutorials/build-a-notion-powered-website>.


🖌️ Visual Editor



We've revamped our visual editor.

 The Visual Editor lets you select elements in your app's preview and edit 
them directly. You can change text right from the preview, adjust styles like 
padding and colors with simple controls, and see all changes instantly.

When you're done, your code updates automatically, saving you time and effort. 
Learn more in ourdocs. 
<https://docs.replit.com/replitai/visual-editor#visual-editor> 


📌 Other new features


 * Enhanced Checkpoints & Time Travel: Agent checkpoints just got a whole lot 
better—you can now view an entire history of your checkpoints in Agent.Time 
Travel <https://x.com/_jzhao/status/1923095488527548622> means you can see a 
preview of your app at any point in time

your Agent apps in seconds. Learn more about our Agent Integrationshere 
<https://docs.replit.com/replitai/integrations#paypal>
 * Enterprise and teams: Protected development previews for secure iteration, 
viewer seats for broader team collaboration, & advanced seat management (SCIM)
 * Performance improvements: Backend performance and reliability improvements, 
bringing faster Agent responses. 90% of Agent responses are now 90% faster
 * Extended preview times: Previews are now active for a default 10 minutes 
when navigating away from your apps—this is up from our previous 20 seconds
 * Auth gets even better: We've made Auth 
<https://docs.replit.com/replit-workspace/replit-auth#replit-auth> available to 
all users—add login to your apps in seconds ask Agent ""add auth"" or ""add login""

 You can also find weekly updates in our Changelog!

This beginner&#39;s course covers,"Here are this week's five freeCodeCamp resources that are worth your time:

1. freeCodeCamp just published a full course to help you learn Python for Data Science. This beginner's course covers popular Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn. First you'll learn how to configure your development environment. Then you'll dive in and practice key skills like Data Extraction, Dataframe Concatenation, Data Visualization, and even some basic Machine Learning. (17 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-python-for-data-science-full-course

2. freeCodeCamp also published a full-length handbook that you can read right in your browser on the emerging field of Agentic AI Systems. Agents can go out and attempt tasks in the real world for you. Think of a shopping agent that knows your shoe size and preferences, and tries to find you the best deal on bowling shoes. You'll also learn how these systems use planning and goal setting rather than predefined actions. You can code along at home with the handbook and by the end of it, you'll have your own simple Python and LangChain-powered agent. (full-length handbook): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-agentic-ai-handbook/

3. On this week's podcast I interview a senior dev who was just laid off last week at Microsoft, and he walks us through everything. He has nerves of steel and seems totally unfazed by his coming job search. He talks about the role that both long-term planning and daily trail running have played in giving him resilience. It's clear to me that he's taken the time to prepare himself and his family for just about anything. (1 hour watch or listen in your favorite podcast app): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/laid-off-but-not-afraid-with-x-senior-microsoft-dev-mackevin-fey-podcast-173/

4. If you're traveling this summer, you might benefit from reading this guide on how attackers most commonly use technology to exploit travelers. You'll learn how to defend yourself against fake wi-fi networks, phony travel sites, shady SIM card vendors, ATM skimming, and more. (10 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-attackers-target-travelers-and-how-to-defend-yourself/

5. Learn how to run an inexpensive Raspberry Pi computer in “Headless Mode”. Instead of functioning like a traditional computer with a keyboard, mouse, and screen, you can set up your Pi to perform tasks in the background, then access it remotely through a network protocol like Secure Shell (SSH). This way you can have a dedicated home automation server or a surveillance system. This tutorial will walk you through everything you need to know to get your headless server online. (20 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-your-raspberry-pi-headlessly-with-vs-code-and-ssh/

These are just a few of the open source learning resources the global freeCodeCamp community published this week. We're all working hard to increase the amount of learning people do, so that we can all be prepared to navigate this wild period in human history. Please consider joining the 11,331 kind folks who support our charity and our mission: https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate

Quote of the Week: “One of the things I love about computers is there are so many different rungs on the ladder of abstraction. And each layer has its own interesting challenges. When I moved from Intel to Microsoft, I went from very low-level hardware-adjacent development to cloud development at internet scale. But everything I had learned earlier helped me ramp up quickly at that higher level of abstraction.” —  MacKevin Fey on this week's freeCodeCamp podcast

Until next week, happy coding.

👋 Hey it's Matt,

While AI keeps making headlines, the real magic is in what our community is 
building. I'm continually amazed by the apps we're seeing from our users—they 
just keep getting better.

This month's showcase features: a curated movie-recommendation engine, a 
camera-based fitness movement counter, a savings calculator (for ships!), and 
much more.





 Already have a great project? Submit your app to be featured.

Your Watchlists 🎥



Your Watchlists <https://yourwatchlists.com/> offers a ranked list of the 
greatest films ever made, combining insights from seven respected ""Top Movies"" 
lists.

Log in to mark movies as ""Seen"" or ""Want to See,"" create your personalized 
watchlist, and share it with friends to compare your cinematic journeys.

 From the creator, Brendan: ""My hope is that people use this site to expose 
themselves to movies they may not have otherwise watched, but with a little 
nudge, they end up experiencing some life-changing films, as I have.""

Thanks Brendan! (X Profile <https://x.com/therealbrendanb>)


MoovCounter 🏃



MoovCounter <https://moovcounter-phe.replit.app/> is a fitness app that uses 
your device's camera for real-time pose estimation, allowing you to count 
movements during workouts. It displays a live camera feed with an overlay of 
detected body parts, making it easier to track your exercise. See it in action
here <https://x.com/HrtPhil/status/1908233807066460160>. 

From the creator, Philippe ""[It allows me to] exercise while talking to my 
coach or listening to podcasts.""

Wayfinder Calculator 🚢



 The Wayfinder Calculator <https://wayfinder-calculatorv3.replit.app/> is an 
interactive maritime tool that shows shipping companies how much money and CO₂ 
they can save using Wayfinder's routing technology. It includes real-time fuel 
prices and dynamic visualizations to make complex efficiency calculations 
accessible.

 From the creator, Shane: ""This app is a game-changer for shipping companies! 
Ship operators can literally see how many cars worth of CO₂ they're taking off 
the road, share results with stakeholders in one click, and make rock-solid 
business cases for sustainability tech.""

I think this is an amazing example of using software to directly address a 
business need.

 Thanks Shane!  <https://replit.com/@sswiderek>


OnTapSEO 📝



OnTapSEO <https://ontapseo.com/> is an end-to-end SEO auto-pilot tool. It's 
also one of the most beautiful sites I've seen!

It gathers information about a user's site, brainstorms targeted keywords, 
fills a content calendar, writes SEO-optimized articles with unique thumbnails 
daily, and publishes directly to connected websites like Replit or Webflow 
blogs.

From the creator, Gerrard: ""I run several online businesses, and SEO is the 
primary marketing channel. This app lets me just add my keywords for each site 
for the month in a few minutes, then set it and forget it as it publishes new 
content to my blogs daily... From first prompt to deployed app was 38 days, 
while I was working on several other projects. Thanks so much for what you guys 
are building with Agent, it's a life-changer.""

 Thanks Gerrard! (X Profile <https://x.com/GerrardL_>, LinkedIn 
<https://www.linkedin.com/in/gerrardlipscombe/> <https://x.com/GerrardL_>)


TagYourRide 🚔



TagYourRide <https://tagyourride.com/> is a fun vanity license plate name 
generator. Users enter keywords, select their state, and the app generates six 
creative ideas that meet the state's character requirements, even rendering 
them on an image of the state's license plate.

 From the creator, Brian: ""I was looking for an app to generate custom license 
plate ideas. I couldn't find one so I used ChatGPT. Then I realized that this 
should exist as a standalone app, so I created it in less than an hour. Replit 
is awesome!""

 Thanks Brian! (X Profile <https://x.com/BSbriansallee>, LinkedIn 
<https://www.linkedin.com/in/salleebrian/> <https://x.com/BSbriansallee>)


Sarasota.tech 🌴



Sarasota.tech <https://sarasota.tech/> is a member directory that enhances the 
Luma API, transforming a community calendar into an interactive business 
directory and community hub. It provides a modern dashboard for upcoming and 
past events and a directory of listed members.

 From the creator, Raymmar: ""We were able to turn our static website into an 
interactive membership hub for our local meetup without the need to stitch 
together a bunch of random platforms... It is a powerful member platform built 
on top of the Luma API and we are even considering offering this to other Luma 
communities. I feel like a sorcerer when I use Replit.""

 Thanks Raymmar! (X Profile <https://x.com/raymmar_>, LinkedIn

******************
Lovable update —
May 24th
******************

Hey,

In the last two weeks we've made Lovable a lot better by fixing bugs and more.

This everything we've done:

--------------------------
Lovable now uses Claude 4!
--------------------------

Lovable now uses Claude 4!

Anthropic released new AI models a few days ago and within hours this was live inside Lovable.

This makes Lovable:

* 25% less error prone
* 40% faster

Go and create a new project ( https://lovable.dev/ ) and see if you feel a difference!

------------
Improvements
------------

* Revamped the setup flow for both GitHub and Supabase, simplifying multi-step onboarding to reduce confusion.
* Added visual labels to featured projects on the homepage for better discovery.
* Added support for removing custom domains from your Lovable app.
* Commit messages now rely more on conversation history for better context.
* Improved the quality of streaming: smoother experience and no more flashing text.
* Users can now view public Lovable projects without being logged in.
* Active edit cards are now highlighted so it’s easier to see which one is active.
* The default “Edit Code” button now opens the preview instead of the raw code.

Several improvements in collaborator management:

* Added validation to the email invite form in the People tab
* Tooltips now explain the permissions for each role (admin / owner / editor)
* You can now see the role of pending invites
* Better error messages for edge cases like inviting someone already in the workspace

---------
Bug fixes
---------

* Fixed bugs that caused the wrong live preview to show in some cases.
* Fixed a bug where refreshing the preview could change the current path.
* Fixed a bug that caused infinite redirect loops when starting a live preview after logging in.

Thanks for being a user of Lovable, we're working hard to make the experience as good as possible with minimal errors.

1. freeCodeCamp just published a course on building AI agents using the open source LangChain LangGraph Python framework. This course will teach you fundamental Agentic AI concepts like Elements, Type Annotations, and Retrieval Augmented Generation. You can code along at home, and by the end of the course you'll have built 5 different agents you can show to your friends. (3 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-langgraph-and-build-conversational-ai-with-python/

2. freeCodeCamp also published this comprehensive guide to Relational Database Management Systems. You'll learn key database architecture concepts and how to diagram them. You'll also learn about Relational Algebra, Data Normalization, Schema Design, SQL Queries, and more. (9 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/master-database-management-systems/

3. On this week's freeCodeCamp podcast, I interview a developer from Iraq about her journey into tech. She has managed to build out her professional reputation through live-streaming herself participating in online coding and data science competitions. She shares tips for making friends with other developers – even when you're living far away from tech hubs like Silicon Valley. (90 minute watch or listen in your favorite podcast app): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-developer-friends-when-you-dont-live-in-silicon-valley-with-iraqi-engineer-codelife-podcast-172/

4. Learn what JavaScript Linting is and how it helps you write better code. This tutorial will also teach you about Abstract Syntax Trees and why they're so useful for representing code. (20 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-javascript-lint-rules-work-and-why-abstract-syntax-trees-matter/

5. I'm thrilled to announce that freeCodeCamp just published our first-ever course on a world language. This full-length Spanish for Beginners course will teach you basic grammar and vocabulary so you can speak at a CEFR A1 Level. The instructor has more than 17 years of experience teaching Spanish to beginners. ¡Vámonos! (9 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-a1-level-spanish/

As you may know, last year freeCodeCamp published our English for Developers curriculum, and we're continuing to expand it. Even though we focus 90% on teaching programming, we hope to eventually cover many other professional skills like world languages as well. I want to thank each and every one of the 11,371 kind people who support our charity. Please consider joining them in supporting our mission: https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate

Quote of the Week: “I had never coded before I started my Computer Science degree. I felt behind compared to my peers. But I started searching online. I found freeCodeCamp. Just being able to write code in the browser and see the output – that was what made coding feel practical and doable.” — Iraqi Software Engineer Code;Life on this week's freeCodeCamp podcast

Until next week, happy coding.

Hi there,

Thanks to vibe coding, more people than ever can create software.

 AI coding is powerful but can be nerve wracking if you're building something 
for the first time.

Is my user information safe? Is my API key exposed? Will my app be vulnerable 
to attackers?

Today we’re making Replit even safer so you can continue to create with 
confidence:

✓ Even better security: built-in safeguards by default


 * Built-in secure login for your apps (no technical setup required)
 * Automatic security checks that find and fix issues for you
 * Smart detection to keep your private keys safe

✓ Time travel through App History with confidence


 *  Easy-to-browse timeline of all your app versions
 * Preview a fully functional version of your app in the past before going 
back to that version
 * Restore both your code and your data to previous states (certain features 
coming soon)

✓ Enterprise-ready: vibe coding for professionals


 *  Control who can see your apps with privacy settings
 * Easy user management for organizations
 * Simple tools to share internal apps securely

 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o76diiNCJwA>

Unlike other vibe coding platforms that require technical expertise to stay 
secure, Replit handles the complex parts for you, giving you peace of mind 
while you create.

Want to see how these features make building software easier? 
 Check out our blog post <https://blog.replit.com/safe-vibe-coding> for the 
full story, orbook a friendly demo <https://replit.com/teams#inlineForm> with 
our team.

Happy creating,
The Replit Team

You&#39;ll,"Here are this week's five freeCodeCamp resources that are worth your time:

1. freeCodeCamp just published a comprehensive course that will help you learn modern Android app development. You'll learn how to use Android Studio alongside the Kotlin language, a popular alternative to coding in Java. The final project involves building a clone of the Uber app – complete with map integration and real-time location tracking. (60 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/master-kotlin-and-android-60-hour-course/

2. And after you're done with that 60 hour course, try this other 60 hour course ;) It's a full-length Generative AI bootcamp led by CTO and AI enthusiast Andrew Brown. You'll learn powerful tools like Juptyer Notebook and Ollama. You'll also get exposure to the latest applied machine learning techniques. This course is designed to be reasonably accessible to non-developers as well, so any curious person can learn how to harness the power of these new tools. (65 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/free-genai-65-hour-bootcamp/

3. On this week's freeCodeCamp podcast I interview software engineer and prolific freeCodeCamp contributor Sam Crombie about life in San Francisco startup purgatory. Sam left his job at Microsoft to go through Y Combinator, and is currently trying to find product-market fit as a lone-wolf developer. We discuss how useful AI coding tools really are, tips for getting people to care about your apps, and how parents can help their kids get scholarships for Ivy League schools. (2 hour watch or listen in your favorite podcast app): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/ditching-a-microsoft-job-to-enter-startup-hell-with-lonewolf-engineer-sam-crombie-podcast-171/

4. Learn how to build web apps faster with Vite, a new JavaScript front end build tool. Vite means quick in French. And this quick course wastes no time in showing you the ropes. You'll learn about Hot Module Replacement, Optimized Dependency Prebundling, Intelligent Caching, and more. (1 hour crash course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-vite-for-a-better-web-development-workflow/

5. Learn how to become a better analytical programmer by analyzing five different JavaScript implementations of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game. Along the way, you'll learn how to use visual tools for code comparison, and learn how to diagram codebases using Mermaid.js. I hope this helps you broaden your horizons as a dev and appreciate the many ways you can accomplish simple tasks with code. (2 hour read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-become-an-analytical-programmer-compare-five-projects/

If you haven't made plans for summer yet, consider going all-in on the freeCodeCamp core curriculum. We've got a ton of interactive coding projects waiting for you. You can beat the heat and gain some serious ground with your skills. And if you want to help our charity build even more open source learning resources, I encourage you to support our mission directly: https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate

Quote of the Week: 
“You can do all the user research you want. But at some point, you just need to put your project out there. My biggest false starts came from not launching. I've learned that you can’t just theory-craft forever. You have to actually ship.” — Sam Crombie on this week's freeCodeCamp podcast, sharing lessons from startup “pivot purgatory”

Until next week, happy coding.

Sir/Madam,

Greetings from AICTE!

As you aware that “Study Webs of Active Learning for Young Aspiring Minds”
(SWAYAM) is an initiative under the Ministry of Education, Government of
India, designed to provide quality education to all, in line with the three
cardinal principles of the National Education Policy –access, equity, and
quality. SWAYAM is a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) platform aimed
at democratizing education, particularly for those unable to join the
mainstream knowledge  economy due to various barriers.

Mr. Suraj Kr. Maurya, Training Officer, NIOS, one of the ten National
Coordinators of SWAYAM across India, has conducted a research study on
“SWAYAM &amp; SWAYAM Plus: Catalysts for Inclusive Education in India” and
has formulated a bilingual Questionnaire along with a QR Code  as per  his
letter No. F-82-20/2025/NIOS/CBC/SWAYAM, dated 12.03.2025 (attached for
ready reference).

You are requested to please disseminate the above bilingual Questionnaire
among all faculty, students, learners and others concerned to scan the QR
Code of the bilingual questionnaire and send their feedback to email:

Concerning the above, this is to bring to your kind attention that after
the successful execution of the two editions of PM-YUVA Mentorship Scheme,
PM-YUVA Mentorship Scheme 3.0 has been launched by the Ministry of
Education, Government of India  * to train young and budding authors  *
(below 30 years of age) for the year 2025-26 with the National Book Trust,
India as the Implementing Agency. The Themes of PM-YUVA 3.0 are:

a.Contribution of Indian Diaspora in Nation Building

b.Indian Knowledge System

c.Makers of Modern India (1950-2025)

The scheme will help to develop a stream of writers who can write on
various facets of India encompassing the past, present and future. Besides,
the scheme will also provide a window to the aspiring youth to articulate
themselves and present a comprehensive outlook of contribution of Indians
across fields in ancient and present times.

The scheme aims to cultivate a new generation of writers who can articulate
the contributions of the Indian diaspora in nation-building, highlighting
their peaceful integration and influence across political, economic, and
socio-cultural spheres. It will also emphasise on the role of the Indian
Knowledge System in preserving historical wisdom, generating new
opportunities, and synthesising indigenous knowledge for national
development.

Through this initiative, young authors will explore the impact of
visionaries in various fields like education, science, economy, social
empowerment, etc. thereby presenting a comprehensive narrative of India's
growth and resilience. Given India’s position as the third-largest book
publishing market, this initiative is a crucial step toward projecting its
intellectual and cultural wealth on the global stage.

An online National Contest is being organised from 11 March 2025 – 10 June
2025 to select the authors under the Scheme. There is a provision for
payment of a Scholarship of Rs.50,000 per month for a period of six months
to be paid to each of the selected 50 authors. National Book Trust, India
will be publishing the books produced by the young authors as part of the
Mentorship Scheme.
* You are requested to disseminate the information pertaining to the Scheme
among the students and other stakeholders to encourage greater
participation in this prestigious scheme. *

Respected Madam/Sir,

*Greetings from AICTE!*

The *National Innovation Challenge for Drone Application & Research (NIDAR)* is
India’s largest national drone innovation challenge hosted by the Ministry
of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) and Drone Federation
India (DFI) under the *SwaYaan* Initiative. SwaYaan is a National
Initiative by MeitY to develop and strengthen India’s UAS/Drone ecosystem,
aligning with the Government’s vision to make India a global drone hub by
2030. The Drone Federation India (DFI) is a non-government, non-profit,
industry-led body representing 550+ drone companies and 5500+ drone pilots
across the country.

With prizes, startup incubation, and industry mentorship, NIDAR inspires
students and researchers from academia to build collaborative
autonomous drones for solving real-world problems in disaster management
and precision agriculture. Through this initiative, participants gain
hands-on experience, industry-relevant skills, and access to career
opportunities in India’s rapidly growing drone sector. NIDAR aims to be a
transformative milestone in shaping India’s future of drone technology and
aerospace innovation.

Hey again,

Have you ever thought about earning money from Lovable? Here are a few ways people in our community are doing it:

* Offer Freelance Projects – Our user Sarah pitched a local restaurant with an outdated ordering system and rebuilt it faster and more affordably than an agency. With Lovable’s tools (like Stripe checkout), she delivered quickly and landed a happy customer.
* Build & Monetize SaaS – Multiple Lovable users have launched subscription-based apps that bring in recurring revenue. For inspiration, check out Renamify ( https://renamify.co/ ) or Aneta ( https://www.aneta.so/ ) (both powered by Lovable).
* Consulting & Workshops – Harry teaches local businesses how to create efficient web tools using Lovable via paid workshops.
* Become a Lovable Partner ( https://lovable.dev/partners ) – It’s the easiest way to connect with clients looking for custom solutions in our community. As a partner, you’ll get priority access to new projects, plus the freedom to build on your own terms.

We’re excited to see how you’ll leverage Lovable to turn your passion into income.

Got an inspirational story to share? Reply to this email or post it on x.com and tag @lovable_dev. Can't wait to hear from you!

Hey it's Matt!

 They say April showers bring May flowers—April was a busy month at Replit & 
May is shaping up to be a superbloom. 💐

April's product updates include a mix of new features and polish:


 * Replit Auth: add users and login, instantly
 * A new homepage: designed to spark inspiration & innovation
 * Agent improvements: better checkpoints & performance improvements
 * Replit improvements: improved secrets syncing, polish, & bug fixes

and much, much more!




👤 Add users & login with just a click



Replit Auth is now out for all. 

What's auth? Well, it's a way to add users / login to your apps. Typically, 
auth is a hard problem... That's why there are entire industries dedicated to 
it.

Replit Auth is backed by our services, so we handle things like password / 
email reset, storing user data, security, and more.

Get started by adding the following to your Agent prompt: Add Replit Auth. 


✅ Improved checkpoints



 Checkpoints just got a whole lot better: simpler messages, a checkpoint 
preview, and a new design.

We're making it easier to understand where you've been so you can move forward 
and build better features.


🏠 New home, who dis?



We've rolled out our new homepage and it's pretty neat.

 Head to a logged-out replit.com <https://replit.com> to give it a look.


📌 Other new features


 * Better secrets sync: We've improved secrets syncing between development and 
deployments, so you'll never have to worry about mismatched values
 * Mobile app onboarding: If you haven't tried Replit Mobile 
<https://replit.com/mobile>, we've got a new onboarding and improved design to 
help you ship on the go! 
 * Better file uploads: You'll notice our file drag-n-drop is better than 
ever. Upload some images to your project to see it in action
 * Teams improvements: For our B2B users, we've got new features rolling out 
for all teams, including better invites, advanced privacy settings, and more. 
If you're interested in Replit at work, checkit out <https://replit.com/teams>
 * Performance improvements: Backend performance and reliability improvements, 
bringing faster Agent responses. We also matchintegrations

🔮 Looking Ahead


The ways we build continue to change. We're at the forefront of a shifting 
landscape—it can be both exciting and daunting.

 Every day I wake up excited to keep creating, learning, & sharing.

I genuinely hope it can help you make sense of all these new tools and ideas. 
Let's keep creating apps and moving forward.

Until next time,

Hi,

I noticed that you never connected any of your lovable apps to a backend (Supabase) which I highly recommend.

With Supabase, your Lovable app is enabled to...

* Save data - so that information you add in your app doesn't disappear when you refresh
* Allow login - so that people can sign up to your app and have their own profile
* Connect APIs - like OpenAI for AI functionality or Stripe to collect Payments

These are the simple steps:

* Create a Supabase account & project here ( https://supabase.com/dashboard/sign-up )
* Build your app on Lovable and click ""Connect Supabase"" ( https://lovable.dev/ )

Start Building Now ( https://lovable.dev )

 Meet Martin 

 <https://www.chess.com/play/computer/Martin-Bot?utm_campaign=website&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Iterable> 

 Hi hope079, my name is Martin and I played over 250 million chess games last 
year. Sure, I might have lost a few hundred million more times than I won, but 
I still have fun playing. Want to play a game? 

 Challenge Martin Now  <https://www.chess.com/play/computer/Martin-Bot?utm_campaign=website&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Iterable> 


 <https://www.chess.com/play/online?utm_campaign=website&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Iterable> 

 Want Another Challenge? Try a Timed Game! 


 <https://www.chess.com/play/online?utm_campaign=website&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Iterable> 

 If your clock runs out of time during a game of chess, you lose! Do you know 
the difference between the four main types of timed games on Chess.‌com? It all 
comes down to how much time you start each game with. 


 <https://www.chess.com/play/online?utm_campaign=website&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Iterable> 

 Start by challenging a friend to a slower game until you get used to playing 
with a live clock!

*****************************************
Introducing Lovable 2.0 —
now smarter, multiplayer, and more secure
*****************************************

Hey, Lovable 2.0 is finally here!

Today, we’re making Lovable smarter with a chat mode agent, adding multiplayer so you can collaborate with your team, enhancing security with project scanning, and more.

See announcement video here ( https://youtu.be/xDwR1_vrIg8?si=iTNR4pBJ8bHpKI9J ).

This is everything that's new:

----------------
New Brand and UI
----------------

New Brand and UI

We've made ourselves more lovable. Our new brand, and cleaner UI, is as bold as you feel when turning your dreams to reality.

Go to Lovable.dev ( https://lovable.dev/ ) to see it for yourself.

-----------
Multiplayer
-----------

Multiplayer

Each subscription is now connected to a workspace.

Users with a Pro subscription have personal workspaces. You can still invite up to 2 people to individual projects. Collaborators on a project use project owner credits.

Users with a Teams subscription can have up to 20 users in their workspace. Owners & admins can freely invite & remove users and manage projects. Editors can only make edits to existing projects. All users in a workspace share the connected credit pool.

Perfect for friends, startups, and smaller enterprise teams collaborating on the same app or wanting centralized billing.

This feature is being
rolled out in stages – if you don’t see it yet, it’s on the way!

---------------
Chat Mode Agent
---------------

Chat Mode Agent

Our new chat mode agent is 10x smarter and doesn't make edits to the code. This is perfect for asking questions, planning your project, and debugging. This mode is agentic, meaning it can reason across multiple steps and decide when to search files, inspect logs, query the database, and more.

-------------
Security Scan
-------------

Security Scan

Easily surface security vulnerabilities in your app before publishing with Lovable’s new Security Scan feature. You will find the results of the scan in the publish dialog for Supabase-enabled apps.

This is just the start of many things we'll do in the coming months to make vibe coding more secure.

---------------
Pricing updates
---------------

We’ve simplified our pricing into two clear options: a Pro plan,
with flexible tiers starting at $25/month, and a Teams plan, starting at $30/month for teams that need shared workspaces.

See our pricing page ( lovable.dev/pricing ) for all details.

------------------------
Join the Lovable 2.0 AMA
------------------------

​We’re hosting a live AMA to wrap up the launch, answer your questions, and share what’s next.

​Anton (Lovable founder) and the team will be there — tune in and ask us anything!

​We’re crowdsourcing questions on X — drop yours in the thread once we post it and join us live for answers.

Sign up here: https://lu.ma/xkuww33l

--------------------------
We're just getting started
--------------------------

This is a new chapter for Lovable. In the coming months, we’re making the product more powerful, secure, and intuitive.

Thank you all for your support.

Dear Sir/Madam,

Please share the email below with your students to get benefit as an
EC-Council Academia Partner.

Dear students,

*EC-Council has launched Hackerverse **Capture the Flag (CTF) challenge**.
Find the details below and register using your CHARUSAT email id for the
same.*

Hackerverse is a global cybersecurity competition ecosystem designed by
EC-Council to support and advance the cybersecurity community worldwide.
Rooted in EC-Council’s longstanding commitment to empowering cybersecurity
professionals worldwide, Hackerverse provides a competitive arena for
individuals across all proficiency levels to demonstrate their skills
through rigorous, gamified *Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges*.

Hackerverse was officially unveiled at Hacker Halted 2022, EC-Council’s
annual cybersecurity conference that unites ethical hackers, security
professionals, and industry leaders from across the globe. A platform for
thought leadership and technical exchange, Hacker Halted serves as a
convergence point for innovation, research, and discourse on emerging cyber
threats and defense strategies.

Hackerverse has helped EC-Council to broaden its impact, transitioning from
localized cybersecurity competitions to a truly global competitive
platform. *Through Hackerverse CTF, a year-long, free-to-enter Capture the
Flag (CTF) challenge on Hackerverse, cybersecurity professionals and
enthusiasts from around the world can now test their skills on a much
larger stage. *The competition features a dynamic scoring system that
rewards participants for speed and precision, reflecting the high-stakes
nature of cybersecurity. *With over $100,000 in prizes, it represents
EC-Council’s commitment to supporting and rewarding cybersecurity talent
worldwide.*

As cyber threats continue to evolve, Hackerverse remains a dynamic proving
ground, ensuring that the next generation of cybersecurity professionals is
prepared to meet the challenges of an increasingly complex digital
landscape.

Hi there,

Anton here, founder of Lovable.

We’re rolling out major upgrades to Lovable in the coming days
----------------------------------------------------------------

Faster performance, greater reliability, and powerful new capabilities.

To support these changes, we’re also launching new subscription plans.

Last chance to lock in current plans & early user discount
----------------------------------------------------------

If you subscribe before the changes go live, you can still lock in our current plans — and a unique discount code for new plans that we’ll send as a thank you to our early users.

It’s the best time to join Lovable. Looking forward to
build together.

Hola it's Matt 👋

They say April showers bring May flowers, but amazing apps are blooming 
year-round on Replit.

 This user showcase features a space-saving PDF app, a podcast discovery 
platform, a game giving Wordle a run for its money, and a tool for learning 
your next great vocab word.

Let's jump in ✨





Already have a great project? Submit your app to be featured.

Submit your app <https://forms.gle/4SHuSUZRhQShEZVv7> 


PodNudge: <https://podnudge.com/> Finding your favorite podcast shouldn't be 
so hard. PodNudge is a lightweight discovery engine for podcasts.

PodNudge connects with Podcast Index API for comprehensive show data and 
integrates with Plink for easy show and episode linking.

From the creator: ""This was my first Replit Agent built app. This was before 
the term vibe code was penned on the Internet. I felt the vibes instantly when 
iterating with Replit Agent on PodNudge. It opened my eyes to see the 
possibilities of going from problem (need better podcast search independent of 
platform) to idea (build a lightweight podcast search) to prototype.""

 Thanks Mark <https://x.com/MarkMathson>!



LowCarbPDF:  <https://lowcarbpdf.com/>Compressing PDFs shouldn't be 
complicated. This simple tool helps you reduce PDF file sizes instantly—no 
persistent storage means your sensitive documents stay secure. And though we 
love carbs, we appreciate the diet pun!

 Just upload, compress, and download. That's it. Perfect for businesses that 
regularly need to shrink PDFs for uploads to systems with tight file size 
limits.

From the creator: ""[I built it] specifically for one client who has trouble 
uploading PDFs to a health insurance company. I also created LowCarbTIFF.com 
for this client, as they receive weird TIFF files and used to have to hire me 
to reduce their size about once a week. Now, they just use the site!""

 Thanks Eric <>!



WordLeap: <https://wordleap.co.uk/> As someone who's constantly trying to 
expand my vocabulary, I know the struggle of retaining new words.

 WordLeap tackles this with a sleek flashcard system that helps you create, 
manage, and study customized decks of word pairs. Track your progress, review 
learned words, and build your vocabulary systematically.

 For this creator, Agent unlocked the ability to build a full-featured 
application with integrated Stripe payments, database functionality, cloud 
storage, OpenAI capabilities, caching, GitHub-synced development and production 
environments, and efficient state management through hooks.



Wiblet: <https://wiblet.com/> There's something addictive about word games 
that challenge both your vocabulary and quick thinking.

 Wiblet puts your word skills to the test with a 4x4 grid of letters where you 
tap to form words against the clock. Compete on daily leaderboards, track your 
progress, and push yourself to find longer words under pressure—all playable 
instantly from any device without downloads.

From the creator: ""Wiblet empowers users to challenge their vocabulary and 
reflexes in a fun, fast-paced way. It offers a quick mental workout that's easy 
to pick up but hard to put down.""

Thanks Joe <https://www.linkedin.com/in/joemurfin/>!


🔮 What's next


 There's something in the air—these vibe-coded <https://youtu.be/5OWurmg41tI> 
apps are getting better and better. Today, anyone can ship their ideas.

If you've never built before, now is the best time to get started.

 Jump in and try something new. If you get stuck, check out our docs or 
tutorials to get unblocked. I'm excited to see what you'll create. ✌️

Start building <https://replit.com> 

If you're getting into the weeds and looking to level-up your apps' security, 
give our newest video a watch!

Dear Madam/Sir,

Greetings from All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) ..!

We are pleased to inform you that Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO)
has announced that on 19th April 2025, the satellite ‘Aryabhata’ Golden
Jubilee will be celebrated on Satellite Technology Day.

Under the leadership of Hon'ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi,
India has achieved several historic milestones in space technology in
recent
years, including the Chandrayaan-3 and Gaganyaan missions. Keeping in mind
his vision to promote ‘Science and Innovation,’ the aim of this
Golden Jubilee Celebration is to foster scientific thinking in
schools, colleges, and universities, as well as to create awareness and
interest
in space science among students and citizens.

*Students, teachers, and all citizens of the state are invited
to participate in an online webinar about the Golden Jubilee of the
first satellite ‘Aryabhata’ by registering on the following link.*
*Registration Link* :  www.aryabhata.indiaspaceweek.org

In view of the foregoing,  AICTE requests your institution to encourage

Ever got stuck in Lovable? Most of the time, the right set of prompts can get Lovable unstuck.

Here's my strategies for how to prompt when I need to debug an issue:
* My go-to prompt: I ask Lovable to thoroughly think through a problem, identify 5 potential drivers, and propose a plan to work through them step-by-step
* Give Lovable additional context (Developer docs, console error logs, API specs, etc.)
* If not successful, I ask Lovable to add additional error logs & then feed them back in
Ready to try these techniques
in Lovable? ( https://lovable.dev/ )

To dive deeper, check out this video we created with our friend Mark on how to prompt Lovable correctly:

To save on cloud resources I just did a scan of all our projects and identified those which have been inactive for more than 7 days.

Your project Campus (https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/mtphiixxytkpmhhzryqx) was one of those and it is scheduled to be paused in a couple of days.

I wanted to share some important information regarding the *Summer
Internship Program 2025* by *Appifly Infotech*, which many of us recently
received details about.

After further inquiry, it has come to light that the company is asking for
a *₹5000 fee* to participate in the internship. While internships are
valuable opportunities to gain experience, *it's important to be cautious
when companies request payment*, especially without clear justification or
assurance of value.

As fellow students, I strongly *encourage you to reconsider applying* to
this program and to explore *free or merit-based internships* that provide
real learning without financial burden. There are plenty of reputable
companies offering *free internships or even stipends*, and those should be
prioritized for our professional development.

Stay aware and make informed decisions!

Ever wondered how experienced users get their target output 50% faster and get stuck much less often? They use our techniques for prompting Lovable.

It's not hard to get much better results from Lovable:
* Break asks into parts, or ask Lovable to create a step-by-step plan
* With each edit, specify what part to change, and what to change it to
* Include images in your prompts to guide Lovable more precisely
* Talk to Lovable like a human - ""Think through this carefully"" - or even emphasize urgency: ""You will be rewarded if you successfully complete this task""
Check out this guide with 20+ techniques ( https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one ) to amplify your prompting.

To dive even deeper, check out this video we created with our friend Mark on how to prompt Lovable correctly:

Since the publication of Parnas' *""*On the Criteria to Be Used in
Decomposing Systems into Modules,*"" *we have had good advice on how to
design software. However, most software is more difficult to change than it
should be and that friction compounds over time. The Empirical Design
Project seeks to resolve the seemingly-irresolvable tradeoff between
short-term feature progress and long-term optionality, focusing on:

   - How is software actually designed? What can we learn from data about
   how software is designed?
   - When should software design decisions be made? What is the optimal
   moment given unclear and changing information and priorities?
   - How can we enhance the survival of software projects while expanding
   optionality?

Spoiler alert: make design decisions later and in small, safe steps.

Duration: 60 minutes (including audience Q&A)

*Presenter: *
*Kent Beck**, Software Engineer*
Kent Beck is an American software engineer and the creator of Extreme
Programming, a software development methodology that eschews rigid formal
specification for a collaborative and iterative design process. Beck was
one of the 17 original signatories of the Agile Manifesto.

Super excited to welcome you to our community!

I care deeply about you having a great experience from the start and want to share some things to get you going.

While Lovable feels ultra-intuitive, our veteran users say they find it 10x easier to build with Lovable now that they understand how to use it correctly.

If you're already familiar with Lovable: Let's get you started on your first project on Lovable.dev! ( https://lovable.dev/ )

If you're new to Lovable, I highly recommend checking out this tutorial video we created for you:
( https://youtu.be/gqsZGxuymTk?si=HpVC6VBU3RwSLXXo&utm_source=marketinglifecycle&utm_medium=email1nontech&utm_campaign=creativeabtest )

I'm also inviting you to our bi-weekly live onboarding session. Join us and 100s of other new builders to jointly build, share best practices, and answer any questions you have. This is the perfect chance to learn how to make the most of Lovable from day one.

Introducing the New Navigation Experience for MongoDB Atlas 






Hi D24DIT079,



MongoDB is refreshing the Atlas navigation to deliver a more efficient, 
seamless, and productive experience to our customers. These changes will begin 
rolling out the week of April 7th, 2025.




Here's a quick overview of what's changing: 

 * Simplified Project Navigation: The side navigation has been redesigned for 
rapid access to key tools, enabling faster navigation of the Atlas platform 
through four sections: Database, Data, Services, and Security.
 * Clearer Resource Context: The updated top navigation bar, the resource 
navigator, ensures developers always know which resource (e.g., project, 
organization, cluster) they are working on. Switching between resources is now 
simpler, with improved context clarity as users navigate deeper into Atlas. The 
workflow now negates any need to backtrack to a project’s overview.
 * Centralized Utilities Hub: Essential utilities like Alerts, Help, Billing, 
and Identity and Access Management (IAM) are consolidated in one location at 
the top-right corner. This ensures rapid access and saves time. Users can also 
access the product menu to findMongoDB University <https://learn.mongodb.com/>, 
Documentation <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/>, Dev Center 
<https://www.mongodb.com/developer/>, Community Forums 
<https://www.mongodb.com/community/forums/>, and Support 
<https://support.mongodb.com/>. 
 * Atlas Charts Relocation: Atlas Charts will now be accessible via the 
Visualization heading in theData section of the left-side navigation panel.


Below is a sneak peek at what the primary side navigation for Atlas will look 
like on a project level.



Note: MongoDB will roll out the new navigation experience to Atlas 
organizations in phases to ensure a smooth transition to the new navigation.



The new navigation will start rolling out on April 7th, 2025. It will take 
approximately6 to 8 weeks for the navigation to become available to all Atlas 
organizations. All users will experience the new navigation by June 2025.



If you have further questions, please contact your Account Executive or our 
Support Team <https://support.mongodb.com/>.



Best,
MongoDB Atlas Team

Respected Sir/Madam,

Crossword-solving is a powerful cognitive exercise that enhances analytical
thinking, decision-making, memory, concentration, and creativity. It
strengthens problem-solving abilities, fosters a competitive spirit, and
expands vocabulary—skills essential for academic and professional success.

To further promote this engaging and intellectually stimulating activity in
higher education institutions, AICTE, Extra-C, IIM Mumbai, and IIT Madras
have collaborated under an MoU signed on May 21, 2024. As part of this
initiative, the *National Inter-College Crossword Expedition (NICE-25)* is
being organized.

The competition, scheduled between *May and August 2025*, will follow a
hybrid format—online preliminary rounds leading to offline zonal and
national finals. This event provides students with an opportunity to
sharpen their minds while competing on a national platform.

*Attached are the competition guidelines, format, and tentative schedule. *The
MoU can be accessed on the AICTE website. We invite your esteemed

Welcome to MongoDB 




Ready to get your first MongoDB cluster up and running? Start with these four 
steps:

 * Create cluster 
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/tutorial/deploy-free-tier-cluster/>
 * Add IP address to access list 
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security/add-ip-address-to-list/>
 * Create a user 
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/tutorial/create-mongodb-user-for-cluster/>
 * Connect to cluster 
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/tutorial/connect-to-your-cluster/>



 

If you’re more of a visual learner, we’ve put together a six-minute video 
<https://learn.mongodb.com/courses/getting-started-with-mongodb-atlas> that 
guides you through cluster setup.

 <https://learn.mongodb.com/courses/getting-started-with-mongodb-atlas>

Next, you can start building. Populate your newly-created cluster with some of 
our sample datasets. These are great for testing and quick prototyping.

On behalf of Gujarat Vidyapith, we extend our sincere gratitude to you and
your institution for your invaluable support in making the *Odoo x Gujarat
Vidyapith Hackathon ’25 a grand success. Your students' participation in
this 24-hour Hackathon (22nd—23rd March 2025)* played a significant role in

Matt here,

 Vibe coding is taking off & we've seen our users build some amazing apps.

If you're looking to get inspired or see what folks like you have created on 
Replit, this email is for you.

Here are some of our favorites. 🤘

🔨 Product



Find My Sauna: <https://findmysauna.com/> A directory of the best saunas in 
the world, Find My Sauna arose from Jan's own experiences traveling.

 Noticing the difficulties in finding a good sauna, Jan set out to create a 
service on Replit where anybody can find the best sauna in ANY city.

From the creator: ""I was able to build a prototype super fast. A simple csv 
file with all information served as base for the database that replit built for 
me. Then displaying all the data on the page was as simple as taking the info 
from each column.""

 Thanks Jan <https://x.com/JanTovarys>!


👨‍🔬 Research



Tablify: <http://www.tablify.me> I'm not going to lie: I'm a sucker for a good 
table, especially when doing research. I love to compare and contrast in 
tabular format.

 Tablify does just that. Search any topic you'd like and Tablify will use AI 
to organize the results by the most logical categories in a visually appealing 
and satisfying format.

From the creator: ""I've been an early adopter of Agent and use it almost daily 
to build solutions in my day job as a Chief Product Officer (e.g., a tool to 
help my Customer Success team build workflows for customers) and then on the 
occasional weekend (on hobby projects like Tablify)""

Thanks Matt <https://x.com/mattpollins>!


⚾ Sport



FanRanked: <https://fanranked.com> FanRanked revolutionized how I think about 
sports apps. Its head-to-head MLB player voting system creates real-time 
dynasty rankings that are simply brilliant. It's been a huge inspiration for my 
own projects, showing how engaging sports data can be.

From the creator: ""[Replit has enabled] creating a website I always wanted to 
build but never had the technical knowledge or time to create.""

Thanks JD <https://x.com/FanRanked>!


🧑‍🎨 Creativity



Sonic Pics: <https://spacetime-ai.replit.app/> If you haven't noticed, we're 
big on vibes. Sonic Pics is all about getting the vibes from an image and 
generating a playlist on the fly. You'll have to try this one out to believe 
it. It's a really cool app to help you feel what you see.

Thanks Arthur <https://x.com/arthur_cahen>!


📚 Productivity



Meta Tag Analyzer: <https://seo-tag-inspector.replit.app/> Ok, not going to 
lie—I built this one. But have you every built a site only to have the wrong 
image or title show up when you share a link? Me too.

With Meta Tag Analyzer, you can paste in your site and get a concise summary 
of SEO meta tags.

If you want to learn how to build the same tool, you can follow along in our 
free courseVibe Coding 101 with Replit available now at DeepLearningAI 
<https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/vibe-coding-with-replit/>.


🔮 Looking Ahead


The ✨vibes✨ have been outstanding lately—this is just a glimpse of what’s 
possible with Replit.

 If you're looking for more inspiration, we'll be sharing regular updates on 
what our users are building.

If you haven't started building yet, now is the perfect time.

I'm eager to share our recent updates with you. 🚀

Thursday, March 6, 2025


Matt with Replit here ✌️

 February was an incredibly busy month—I'm excited to share what we've been up 
to.

Last month's updates include:


 *  The new and improved Replit Mobile App
 * Building iOS & Android apps on Replit (from the Mobile App if you'd like!)
 * Agent v2 🤯
 * Claude 3.7 Sonnet support

and much, much more!




📱Make an app for that, anywhere



 We've completely rebuilt Replit Mobile from the ground up! Our new mobile app 
delivers a faster, more intuitive coding experience on the go.

 Head to https://replit.com/mobile <https://replit.com/mobile> to give it a 
shot. You can check out a full walkthroughhere. 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yQmQMCoYb0>


Build apps for your phone 



 Replit now supports iOS and Android app creation thanks to React Native and 
Expo.

This includes: enhanced iOS and Android development capabilities, integrated 
mobile preview and debugging tools, and streamlined app store deployment via 
Expo EAS.

 Check out our tutorial further down to get started!


💪 Agent and Assistant


Assistant now supports Claude Sonnet 3.7 as the default model in ""Advanced"" 
mode, allowing you to build with the latest & greatest models.



Agent v2 (Early Access)


We've launched a new Agent experience that is now available to all users. This 
new Agent is faster, more accurate, and more capable than ever.

 It's also powered by Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Anthropic's most advanced model yet.



You can enable the new experience with ""Explorer Mode"" in Replit.

 Learn how to do so here <https://youtu.be/pE_XT2TaXCA>.


We ❤️ databases


Database operations are now faster than ever, with the most expensive 
operation reduced from 200ms to under 1ms.

 Our database viewer now uses Drizzle Studio, providing a more robust and 
developer-friendly experience for interacting with your data.



📚 Docs improvements


We've re-built our docs from the ground up to be more beautiful and 
user-friendly.

 In addition, we rolled out new Quickstart and Introduction pages to make it 
easier to get started on Replit.



The new docs also feature LLM-friendly features—a ""copy page"" button that 
copies the current page directly to markdown, as well as support for 
/llms-full.txt and /llms.txt.




📹 Videos & tutorials


Make an iOS app on Replit. Learn all you need to build your first iOS app and 
get it running with Replit + Expo.

Practical 6
You are the event manager for a large festival, and you have the
opportunity to secure sponsorship from various companies. Each
company offers a sponsorship amount, but their support comes with
certain conditions that affect the overall budget. Each sponsorship deal
has a weight (representing the budget requirement or resources needed)
and a value (representing the financial contribution or visibility
provided). Your goal is to maximize the total sponsorship value while
staying within the festival's budget constraints. This means selecting a
combination of sponsorship deals that will provide the highest overall
contribution without exceeding the available budget. By employing
backtracking as well as branch-and-bound methods, effectively decide
which sponsorship deals to pursue, ensuring the festival's financial
success.

Dear,

The Education Department, Gujarat has been doing persistent efforts to
institutionalize the Innovation & Startup Ecosystem in the State through
policy, platform, and processes. To augment the support system for
nurturing student Start-ups in the State, second edition of Student
Start-up and Innovation Policy (SSIP 2.0) was launched on 05 January 2022.

Under the Policy, various flagship initiatives have been envisaged through
which youth can get adequate opportunities to harness their creative
potential. We have pioneered various Open Innovation Programmes like
hackathon and executed them at a large-scale.

The 6th Edition of “Smart Gujarat Hackathon” with special focus on
Artificial Intelligence will be a step forward towards building smart and
sustainable solutions to complex challenges. In this edition of hackathon
around 15,000 students are expected to participate and work on problem
statements. Challenges from various departments of the State Government,
Public Sector Undertakings, Municipal Corporations, District Collectorate,
District Panchayats and industries will be broadcasted to students across
universities, institutes, and schools.

The program will feature problem statements from various sectors providing
students with ample opportunities to engage in Artificial Intelligence and
other emerging technology-based solution- oriented projects. Moreover,
winning teams will not only receive cash prizes but also invaluable
mentorship support from nodal officers of government departments and
benefits from education department of Government of Gujarat, further
encouraging their pursuit of innovation and excellence.

We request all students from your institute to actively participate in 6th
edition of “Smart Gujarat Hackathon”. This event presents a fantastic
opportunity for students to showcase their problem-solving skills and
innovative thinking. To get more details and further update regarding
registration process and list of sectors students can visit the following

statement online after registration and login in the portal.

Matt here,

 The start of 2025 has been incredible, and we're amazed by what our community 
is creating.

I'm excited to share some standout projects that showcase the diversity and 
creativity of our platform—from AI-powered tools to creative apps that are 
making a real difference.

📚 Education



PromptCraft <http://promptcraftpro.com/>: Learn prompt engineering by solving 
challenges. Designed for non-technical users as a interactive, educational full 
stack app. PromptCraft is an interactive platform designed to teach users the 
art of effective prompting through engaging challenges.

From the creator: ""I can't believe I built a complex full stack application. 
All within 6-8 weeks. It has allowed me to teach others skills which will help 
them 10x their productivity with LLMs."" —Abhijat 
<https://www.linkedin.com/in/asaraswat/>

CPDProof <https://cpdproof.com>: As in, ""Certified Professional Development.""

🔨 Productivity



Gridgoals <https://gridgoals.com>: A playful and visually spectacular app to 
see your habits in a neat little grid. Click any box for a fun effect!

 ""I've been much more consistent and motivated in my 2025 goals. Now, I'm 
working on creating courses to teach people how to build with AI, including 
using Replit Agent."" —Sani <https://x.com/sanisideup_>

Mind Mapper <https://ai-mind-mapper.replit.app/>: A tool for breaking down 
complex topics into manageable subtopics and brainstorming ideas using mind 
maps (using AI of course). Mind Mapper is seriously fun to play and helped me 
brainstorm this email. Great jobDavid <https://x.com/davidstoeckli>! 


🥕 Health and Awareness



Calorease <https://calorease.replit.app/> <https://calorease.replit.app/>: 
Frustrated by excel, paper, and other food journals, Jake set out to create the
fastest food journal on the planet. You have to see it to believe it, but it 
absolutely rips. 🔥

This one might replace MyFitnessPal! Big shout-out to Jake at State Farm 
Calcium Lab. <https://calciumlab.com/>

Guided Letter <https://guidedletter.com/>: Create campaigns with guided 
questions to help your members write strong, personal letters to 
decision-makers. Make it easy for your community to take action with AI 
assistance.

From the creator: ""Replit is helping my community organization, Strong North 
Tahoe, to build tools that help people make a difference! So much of the AI 
focus is on big tech and the scary stuff, so I'm excited to use it to empower 
communities in ways previously unavailable.""

Thanks Nick <https://x.com/TheNicholaus>!


🔍 Search tools



Nowplai <https://nowplai.com>: I think this is an app we've all wanted. 
Nowplai finds song links on every major music platform. Now you can share your 
eclectic music taste with your eclectic friends who don't use Spotify.

 ""I made sharing songs easier in the group chats where some people use Apple 
Music and some use Spotify."" Amazing workEgor <https://x.com/egorka>!

Libscope <https://libscope.replit.app/>: LibScope assists developers in 
discovering the most suitable libraries for their projects. By analyzing your 
project's specific requirements and context, LibScope provides tailored library

New announcement

5 Dynamic Programming Approach
5.1 You are organizing a music festival and need to pack supplies in a  
limited
number of trucks for transport. Each truck has a maximum capacity, and
you have a variety of supplies, each with a specific weight and value. Your
goal is to maximize the total value of the supplies transported without
exceeding the truck's weight limit.
You are given:

 An integer array weights[] where weights[i] represents the
weight of the ith supply item.
 An integer array values[] where values[i] represents the
value of the ith supply item.
 An integer capacity representing the maximum weight the
truck can carry.

You need to determine the maximum total value of supplies that can be
packed into the truck.



5.2 In a bioinformatics lab where you need to compare two DNA sequences
to find the longest common DNA subsequence. This is essential for
identifying similarities and differences between the genetic material of
different organisms, which can help in various biological studies.
Given two strings, s1 and s2, representing the DNA sequences, your task
is to find the length of the longest common DNA subsequence between
them.

Sir/Madam,

Greetings from AICTE!

As you are aware, the national on-line education MOOCs Platform “SWAYAM”
was launched by MOE on 9th July, 2017. A number of top-ranking
Universities/Institutions offer on-line MOOCs/Certificate programmes
through SWAYAM in almost all disciplines including high demand areas of new
technologies.  Till date, more than *13000+* courses have been offered
through SWAYAM and the total enrolment in these courses has crossed *4.6*
Crores.

For the current *Jan 2025 Semester*, *1516* online credit courses
comprising 12 (Twelve) Online Credit Courses are offered on SWAYAM Platform
for learners.  The examinations for these Credit Courses have been
scheduled to be conducted by NTA on *17, 18, 24 and 25 May 2025.* The
enrolment for these credit courses has already started. Registration for
examination of above 1516 online Credit Courses would be announced in due
course of time. The details of the Courses being offered in *Jan, 2025*
Semester are available on SWAYAM website https://swayam.gov.in/
<https://jan-sampark.nic.in/jansampark/click.jsp?tab=pmo&urlid=b60c54b9431137cf3f332a642086a6f82534d034&lat=2025&mid=2f9eea8cbec1ab4661467789302036abb53ae010>
as per the URL given below :

*https://storage.googleapis.com/swayam2_central/assets/pdf/January%202025%20Semester%20Course%20list.pdf
<https://storage.googleapis.com/swayam2_central/assets/pdf/January%202025%20Semester%20Course%20list.pdf>*

The University Grants Commission had earlier notified the *UGC (Credit
Framework for Online Learning Courses through SWAYAM) Regulations, 2021*
during March, 2021 which facilitates an Institution/University to allow
credit transfer up to *40% of the total courses* being offered by any
higher education institution in a particular programme in a semester
through online learning courses on SWAYAM Platform. *AICTE has also adopted
the credit transfer up to 40% on UGC pattern in continuation of AICTE
(Credit Framework for Online Learning Courses through SWAYAM) Regulation*
and has already requested all Universities/Institutions/Colleges, from time
to time, to *allow credit transfer up to 40% of the total courses being
offered in a semester through SWAYAM*. As per Para 4 (1) of UGC (Credit
Framework for Online Learning Courses through SWAYAM) Regulations, 2021,
the schedule of the SWAYAM based online credit courses shall be aligned
with the conventional education semester commencing in the month of *January
and July of every year*. With this, the students studying in conventional
Institutes/Colleges can transfer the credits earned through the SWAYAM
Courses into their academic records.

In view of above, all Technical Higher Education Institutions/Universities/
AICTE Approved Institutions are requested to give wide publicity to the
above 1516 online Credit Courses in their respective Institutions and to
explore the feasibility for credit transfer in respect of these Courses as
per University Grants Commission (Credit Framework for Online Learning
Courses through Study Webs of Active Learning for Young Aspiring Minds)
Regulations, 2021. This will enable Students from all streams of the
respective Universities/Institutions to be aware of the same and encouraged
to benefit from the credit transfer of high-quality MOOCs courses of SWAYAM.

*Thanks & Regards,*



*Dr. Amit DuttaDirector (P&AP/SWAYAM)AICTE,New Delhi-110070*

Dear CHARUSAT Family Members,



""The aim of art is to represent not the outward appearance of things but
their inward significance.” – Aristotle



We are delighted to inform you that the Faculty of Humanities, in
collaboration with Indukaka Ipcowala Institute of Management, CHARUSAT is
hosting a unique and enriching Pichhwai Art Workshop, scheduled for March
1, 2025. The workshop will be held in the afternoon slot, providing an
excellent opportunity to explore and engage with this traditional form of
Indian art. *Further, this workshop also aims at promoting Indian arts and
culture proliferated under NEP 2020*.



The ancient painting technique known as Pichhwai art, which originated in
Nathdwara, Rajasthan, some 400 years ago, is intricately linked to the
area's religious legacy. The background of Lord Shrinathji, a venerated
embodiment of Lord Shri Krishna, has long been decorated with these
paintings, which originated at the Nathdwara temple. The themes mostly
centre on events from Lord Shri Krishna's early childhood, which depict his
favourite festivals, pastimes, and seasonal festivities.In addition to
their traditional function as sacred temple hangings, Pichhwai paintings
have become more and more popular as home decor, interiors for museums, and
art galleries. Beyond paintings, the motifs and intricate designs are now
replicated on textiles, cushion covers, and carpets, preserving the
artistic legacy in contemporary decor.



We have invited upcoming and enthusiastic artists, Shri Mahesh Rabari and
Ms. Muskan Mehta. The artists conducting the Pichhwai Art Workshop are
highly skilled practitioners dedicated to preserving and promoting this
traditional art form. They have mastered the intricate techniques and
symbolism of Pichhwai Art, bringing its rich heritage to life.



*Workshop details are:*



·  *Date: * March 1, 2025

·  *Day: * Saturday

·  *Time: * 1 pm to 4 pm

·  *Venue:  *Centre Square, IIIM

Hugging Face has transformed the landscape of AI development and deployment
with its robust ecosystem of pre-trained models, innovative libraries, and
versatile tools for natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and
more.

In this talk, we’ll uncover how Hugging Face simplifies machine learning
workflows, empowering developers and researchers to achieve more with less
effort. You'll discover the power of the Transformers library and
the pipelineobject, and learn how to leverage pre-trained models to perform
tasks such as NLP, image recognition, and more. We'll explore practical
applications like text generation, sentiment analysis, and question
answering.

Additionally, we'll delve into using large language models (LLMs) to answer
questions based on custom datasets through Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) and learn how to fine-tune pre-trained models for specialized tasks.

Whether you're new to AI or an experienced practitioner seeking to
streamline your workflows, this session will provide actionable insights
and practical guidance to harness the full capabilities of Hugging Face in
your projects.

Duration: 60 minutes (including audience Q&A)

The program session demonstrates how Ahmedabad’s metro network design -
optimum route & 300 year old problem of sliding in the fastest time, will
be solved by soap !! Also, understanding cell divisions and structures
using bubbles, DIY projects like making your own soap, recipe of giant
bubbles etc. Looking at curriculum topic in a different perspective,
Geometry - using a conic section through a shadow of a stick and measuring
earth’s radius, Numbers & Patterns - multiplication table of 2 and
light-reflection pattern in a coffee mug, the path of a ship and a straight
line on earth, Algebra - finding time in a confusing clock with both hands
identical.

 The details of joining the program are given below.

Additionally, we offer leaves following examination timetables, allowing
students to focus on their academic responsibilities during those periods.

The internship duration is typically 2-3 months, providing ample time for
students to gain hands-on experience, practical knowledge in their chosen
field, and an understanding of management environments. If required, we can
also provide detailed descriptions for each domain.

We would be delighted to discuss this opportunity further and understand
the next steps from your side. Our HR Manager, Karnika Shrivastava, is here
to help you with any other information you may need.

Looking forward to your positive response.

Warm regards,

Friday, January 31, 2025


Matt here,

 ✈️ 2025 is flying by. The great news: there has  never been a better time to 
be a builder or a better place to build than Replit (ok, I'm biased).

Our January updates include Agent & Assistant improvements, integrations, a 
better builder experience, Teams updates, performance optimizations, tech 
talks, & more!




🎉 Agent & Assistant Improvements


Agent


 To start, you'll notice shorter build times and faster responses from Agent. 
We've been hard at work on performance and reliability updates.

We've also added new integrations:

• xAI: Build AI-powered apps with Grok. 

• SendGrid: Add email to your apps with SendGrid.

• Slack: Build apps that can read from and write to your Slack workspace. 
Walkthrough videohere! <https://youtu.be/wDWlkVfTo_A>



Assistant


 Assistant now integrates with Workflows for app configuration. If you haven't 
tried outWorkflows <https://docs.replit.com/replit-workspace/workflows>, 
they're a seriously powerful way to configure your Replit Apps.



 You can also execute shell commands directly from the Assistant pane, now 
with added warnings to make sure you don't run any destructive commands.



💪 Builder Experience


We're continuously working to make the experience of building on Replit 
faster, simpler, and as efficient as possible.

 • Easy GitHub import: Put ""replit.com/"" in front of any GitHub URL to import 
it.



• More beautiful apps: React is now the default for frontend projects.

 • Faster Flask: 40x performance boost for Flask deployments.

• Zippier zips: Faster and more reliable zip exports of your apps.

• Smooth autoscale: We've optimized autoscale deployments for speed and 
reliability.

 • Optimized Databases: Databases have been further optimized for cost 
efficiency and performance.


🧑‍🎨 Teams & Organizations


Teams users, we hear you—lots of new Teams functionality dropped in January. 

 • Featured projects: Enhanced project ""featuring"" controls and customizations.

• Mobile search: Teams users can now search Replit Apps on mobile.

• Login flow: Improved Teams login flow.

• Account switching: Better account switching.



🛠️ Other improvements you’ll love 


• Deployments: Better URL pasting—we now handle links with or without https. 
We've also improved error handling for failed deployments. Additionally, DNS 
formatting now better adheres to industry standards.

• Tooling: Shell now features bash autocompletion (just tab-twice). We've also 
added a QR code to the Webview for easy mobile access. You can also resize the 
Webview to popular mobile screen sizes.





📹 Videos & tutorials


Our tech talks from December are now live on YouTube. Join Replit CEO Amjad 
Masad and engineering leaders for an exclusive tech talk showcasing the future 
of collaborative coding and AI, straight from the Replit HQ in Foster City, CA.


 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtuwxIJrnS0> 

Don't know where to start? Our latest tutorial is a gentle intro to building 
without code. Learn to get started prompting with natural language—from idea to 
deployment in just a few minutes.

--------------------------------
I'm sorry, you'll probably find this is a really long article. From the
title, you probably think I'm either about to profess the infinite glory of
AI — or proclaim how it will gradually end the world and take your job.

But I promise that's not what this is. In fact, since you're reading this
here on Dev.to, I promise to tell you why you're likely to do well in a
post-AI world.

For as long as programming has existed, one thing has remained constant:
it’s always been about writing code. Despite how computing has changed over
decades, one thing has remained the same... we write code, and the machine
follows our instructions.

Today, tools like Copilot, Cursor, and ChatGPT are turning that process on
its head. AI doesn’t just follow instructions; it helps create them. You
describe what you need, and it spits out code that gets you halfway
there—sometimes further.

It feels unbelievable.

But it raises unsettling questions. If AI gets better at writing code,
what’s left for developers? Is this the end of a decades-old career—or the
beginning of something far greater?

The best programmers I know are not intimidated by the
hallucination-riddled outputs of ChatGPT and Claude. But the history of
computing suggests that these programmers shouldn't be so confident that
the world won't demand that they adapt anyways.

*The Next Big Abstraction in Computing*
Each shift in the evolution of how we produce software has been a story of
abstraction. The amount of data needed to build an application has not
decreased over time, it's gotten larger. But the words we use to describe
that data have become more expressive and succinct.

*Assembly Language:* No more punch card systems or painstakingly producing
machine code by hand. With assembly, developers could write instructions
using a more human-readable syntax, abstracting away the binary intricacies
of hardware. This meant they could shift focus from managing individual
bytes to designing and building more complex systems—operating systems,
rudimentary user interfaces, and early software applications. It was a big
first step toward programming as we know it today: enabling humans to
communicate with machines without needing to speak like one.


*Compiled Languages*: Portable, high-level code revolutionized programming.
Instead of writing instructions specific to a machine’s hardware,
developers could write code in high-level languages like FORTRAN or C,
which compilers translated into optimized machine code. This abstraction
allowed developers to focus on solving complex problems rather than
worrying about hardware-specific details. The result? The rise of portable,
scalable applications—from enterprise systems to the software that powers
our everyday lives. It wasn’t just about making programming easier; it was
about opening the door to larger, more ambitious projects that transformed
industries.


*Interpreted Languages*: Languages like Python and JavaScript took
abstraction a step further, prioritizing ease of use, flexibility, and
platform independence. With interpreted languages, developers didn’t need
to compile code into machine instructions—they could write and run programs
dynamically, often with instant feedback. This democratized programming,
making it accessible to people who didn’t have traditional technical
backgrounds. Despite being notorious for quirks and inefficiencies, these
languages fueled the web and app revolutions, enabling entire ecosystems of
innovation. Today, countless communities thrive around building micro-SaaS
apps, games, and experimental projects that wouldn’t have been possible
without these accessible tools.

If history has taught us anything, it’s that new tools don’t eliminate
jobs—they create them.



A guy in 1957: ""A compiler could never outperform my hand-crafted machine
code.""

Programming originally meant managing every detail—manually allocating
memory, writing low-level code tailored to specific hardware, and
understanding every intricacy of the machine. A skillset that was
incredibly niche and difficult to acquire. Today's students can
effortlessly render their React pièce de résistance in any environment that
can run a browser, without worrying about the nitty gritty details. Each
leap in abstraction has not only made programming complex systems easier
but has also unlocked countless new opportunities, expanding what’s
possible with far less effort.

I believe AI-assisted coding fits neatly into this ongoing story of
abstractions. Each transition in the evolution of programming has shared a
central theme: that code can be represented as data. Every paradigm shift
has been about abstracting how we describe and manipulate that data. Large
language models take this abstraction one step further: they allow us to
represent code (and anything else generative AI can produce) in the form of
natural language.

*Natural Language*: Generative LLMs have unlocked a form of software
development that was previously relegated to niche artisan programming
languages: the ability to build applications using plain English. Well,
almost. While these models can “autocomplete” their way to appearing
technically proficient, achieving reliable and precise outputs still
requires significant technical expertise. However, their advancing
capabilities give us a preview of an inevitable future where natural
language programming is the de-facto way to produce software.
What Changes for Developers?
Unlike many of the previous paradigm shifts in computing, AI is not just
abstracting code... it is also abstracting effort itself. A strong
developer can describe in detail what they need, and an AI can nearly
handle the rest. ""Agentic"" tools are becoming capable of brainstorming and
planning somewhat autonomously—at least, they give the appearance of doing
so. The code these programs write won't necessarily pass the sniff test of
the top programmers (in fact, the code might not even run), but it doesn't
seem like we're far away from getting consistent and reliable outputs.

AI also isn’t a deterministic tool in the toolbox, like a compiler. There's
a degree of chaos and unpredictability that, when combined with its
approximate knowledge of many things, enables it to act as a pretty good
collaborator. Even if you don't use the code it writes directly, you might
find it's a wonderful rubber-duck, capable of bouncing ideas back and
forth, willing to iterate on any ridiculous thought you have. Its ability
to parse large amounts of documentation quickly is useful when researching
how to go about building a system. And that means the role of the developer
will evolve in a new way.

In the future, the developers with the highest job security won’t
necessarily be the ones most deeply familiar with language features, APIs,
and libraries. AI—even in its current impressive-but-primitive state—can
already approximate much of that information with surprising accuracy.

Instead, the developers who stand to gain the most will be those who excel
at the things AI will (hopefully) struggle with for a long time. AI, at
least as of today, cannot hold an entire business context in its memory. It
doesn’t understand the domain. It doesn’t grasp the customer, the roadmap,
the budget, the politics, the culture, the positioning, the strategy—or the
team’s past failures and victories. It doesn’t exist in the world, building
relationships with the people navigating the ship it’s been prompted to
help steer. And despite its generative capabilities, it has little
meaningful awareness of the industry it’s operating in.


ChatGPT's weakness is it doesn't comment on Jeff-the-product-director's
cool leather jacket to build rapport.

The developer who seeks to exploit this inherent weakness in AI's ability
to build and understand complex relationships will shift their priorities.
It will no longer be worth exerting so much effort to write code, because
large language models will eventually sufficiently abstract the production
of reliable code via natural language. From a programming perspective, it
will suffice for the developer to be just expert enough within their
technical domain to ensure that the machine does not make any critical
technical mistakes.

More importantly, the developer who is adaptable will leverage their deep
understanding of the business domain—an area where AI simply has no ability
to compete, at least for the time being. The developer who has genuine
interest and empathy for the end-users, the business, and the people
working in it, will use AI to build the most effective solutions with
1/10th the effort compared to those who staunchly remain traditional
coders—who, in the eyes of the business, will miss the forest for the trees
pursuing the dopamine-rush of a puzzle well-solved by their own hands.

The developers who thrive will be the ones who learn how to collaborate
with AI, taking advantage of all of its strengths and its weaknesses.

*What Skills Will Developers Need?*
If AI shifts the nature of programming from ""writing code"" to ""articulating
solutions,"" then the skills developers value today will evolve to
universally encompass the soft-skills honed by those who've had time to
build software engineering experience in the pre-AI corporate world.

Initially, the safest group will be senior engineers and managers already
celebrated for delivering measurable business impact. They will reap the
early benefits of this shift, standing just inches from the sheer edge of a
suddenly expanding value chasm that separates them from the incoming junior
developers who have had no opportunity to build technical experience or
domain knowledge. These newcomers have the grave misfortune of trying to
cross a bridge that is suddenly falling apart beneath them.

But even senior engineers won’t be safe forever. The critical move for
senior and junior engineers alike will be to lean heavily on their unique
strengths over AI, and offload everything else.

The ability to articulate a problem clearly and break it down into
actionable logical steps will be a key differentiating skill. AI can
generate code, but it can’t understand ambiguous or poorly framed
requirements. Developers must be highly effective translators of business
needs into prompts that AI can act on effectively. They must provide the
right amount of technical context so as to not let the AI run amok by
either under- or over-engineering a terrible implementation.

While AI can write individual components of a system, it can’t yet design
how all those parts fit together, at least very well. In my personal
experience, it loses sight of the bigger picture quickly, and is an
indecisive pushover when evaluating important decisions. Developers will
need to focus on architecture and integration, ensuring that the pieces
generated by AI fit within the broader system and align with organizational
goals.


We need to refactor this rectangle right here, or we all die instantly.


Developers will need to rigorously evaluate and refine AI outputs, ensuring
they are efficient, secure, and aligned with business objectives. This will
involve a mix of technical expertise and gut intuition honed through
experience with production systems.

The developer who builds trust with stakeholders, understands user pain
points, and advocates for solutions that align with company values will
have a clear edge. These are not skills an AI can replicate (yet), and they
will set the best developers apart. (And arguably, they already do.)

The measure of success as a developer has never been, and still won't be,
how many lines of code you can push—it will be how much impact you can
drive. The winners in this new landscape will be those who:

Ship solutions that actually solve user problems.
Build resilient systems that scale with the needs of the business.
Use AI as a multiplier, not a crutch.
This is a shift from a craftsman mentality to a strategist mentality. The
best developers will spend less time manually refactoring and testing, and
more time solving meaningful problems. The skill of traditionally writing
code will become less and less intrinsically valuable, except in cases
where peak technical performance is vital to the business or product
strategy.

*AI Will Replace Developers Who Don't Adapt*
Here’s the truth: the role of developers isn’t going away, but what
developers do day-to-day will change dramatically. The tasks that are
repetitive, time-consuming, and easily described will be automated. That’s
not a threat—it’s an opportunity.

Developers who embrace this change will have more time to focus on things
that truly matter. Crafting seamless experiences. Discovering innovative
solutions. Solving real world problems.

But those who resist—who double down on manual processes or dismiss the
potential of these tools—risk being left behind. AI isn’t waiting for
anyone to catch up. If you find yourself scoffing at the imperfect code AI
generates today, remember: there was once a great programmer who believed
they would always write better assembly than a compiler. We know how that
story ended.

The beauty of this shift is that it lowers barriers and opens the door for
anyone willing to learn. Generative AI is a tool—not a replacement—and like
every paradigm shift before it, those who embrace it will amplify their
problem-solving capabilities. Whether you’re a junior developer just
starting out or a seasoned architect, AI offers a way to do more, faster,
and with greater focus on what truly matters.

But succeeding in this new era requires adaptation. You can’t approach AI
as just another tool for automation. It’s a collaborator. Learn how to
guide it effectively—how to frame problems, validate outputs, and iterate
on solutions. Shift your focus from the mechanics of coding to the broader
picture: understanding users, designing systems, and aligning with strategy.

AI is abstracting effort itself, freeing developers to put their energy
where it counts: driving real impact. If you can master this transition,
you won’t just keep up—you’ll be able to change the world.

AI Will Amplify Builders—But Replace Manual Work
The highest-performing developers won’t just write code; they’ll use AI to
redefine how businesses operate. By leveraging their technical skills in
collaboration with AI, they’ll automate the definition and translation of
business and user needs, analyze unstructured data to uncover
opportunities, and pinpoint inefficiencies in processes. These developers
won’t just automate workflows—they’ll effectively automate the organization
itself.

It’s not far-fetched to imagine Sam Altman’s prediction of a one-person
unicorn becoming reality within the next decade.

For those in non-technical roles, this should be a wake-up call. Developers
using AI won’t just stick to their traditional domains—they’ll expand into
others, from marketing and operations to design and even product
leadership. Not maliciously, and not intentionally to displace people, but
because AI will give them (or the companies that employ them) the tools to
radically change manual processes that were once untouchable.

*What If I’m Not a Developer?*
The solution is simple: learn to build. Not necessarily to code like a
software engineer, but to design and build systems that solve problems.
Start now, before the gap widens.

AI is transforming the nature of work. Any process that can be automated
profitably, likely will be. This isn’t speculation—it’s the trajectory of
technological progress. The people who understand how to create, build, and
solve problems with these tools will race ahead, automating tasks,
increasing productivity, and unlocking entirely new opportunities.

If you’re in a non-technical role, you might think: ""I don’t need to learn
to code. AI will handle it for me."" That’s partially true—AI tools are
lowering the barriers to entry and making it easier to get started. But the
people who thrive in this era will be the ones who understand and are
well-practiced in the fundamentals of how to build a solution from nothing.

AI isn’t magic. It doesn’t understand your business, your customers, or
your goals. It still relies on human input—on people who can frame
problems, validate outputs, and integrate solutions. Developers already
know how to do this, and they’re collaborating with AI to push boundaries.
You can do it too—it just takes practice and a willingness to adapt.

Dear Students,

We are delighted to share the contributions of our students *(Dhairya Shah
- 23DCS118 and Priyanshu Valiya - 23DCS141) *for the successful completion
of Phase -1 of the Lesson Planning (LP) Portal (Web Application) and making
it live for teachers. This platform is designed to streamline academic
processes and objectives, save valuable time, and enable teachers to
efficiently manage lesson planning for their subjects.

The key contributors of this project are as follows:

   - Dhairya Shah (23DCS118) – Lead Developer & System Architect
   - Priyanshu Valiya (23DCS141) – Next.js Developer
   - Dr. Parth Goel (Coordinator, Teaching Learning Committee) – Mentor and
   Testing of a portal

It is worth noting that this significant task was *completed within just
three weeks*, resulting in Phase 1 (Version 1.0) of the portal. Their
efforts have culminated in a user-friendly and efficient platform that will
benefit the entire institution. This accomplishment is a testament to the
hard work and dedication of our students.

*Let us all take a moment to applaud Dhairya and Priyanshu for their
outstanding accomplishment and be inspired by their dedication.*

We would like to acknowledge and express our gratitude to Dr. Amit Nayak
sir (Process Owner - Teaching Learning Committee) and Dr. Bankim Patel sir
(Principal-DEPSTAR) for their continuous support and valuable suggestions
during the portal's implementation.

Thank you for your continuous enthusiasm and support in making such
initiatives successful.

faith and for the betterment of the functioning of the university (i.e
academic and administrative).



The Whistle Blower policy is attached herewith for information of all the
CHARUSAT family members.

resume to boost your chances of being called in for an interview.

*Cisco Crisis Response team aids in Hurricane Helene relief efforts*



Hurricane Helene struck Florida on September 26th as a powerful Category 4
hurricane, bringing 140mph winds and a 15-foot storm surge to some parts of
the Gulf Coast. While the intensity of the storm diminished after making
landfall, torrential downpours, tornadoes and mudslides from the storm
wreaked havoc in Georgia, Tennessee, and Western North Carolina.



In response to Hurricane Helene, Cisco Crisis Response
<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/csr/impact/cisco-crisis-response.html>
activated
our incident response protocols to quickly mobilize communications assets
and trained personnel. Since the initial impact, 9 CCR staff members and 19
employee volunteers supported response efforts in western North Carolina
and elsewhere in the affected region. We dispatched emergency networking
kits to 11 partner organizations to provide temporary connectivity or
augment capacity. The team also provided remote support and configuration
assistance to affected organizations, including a virtual Security
Operations Center to monitor deployed networks. Volunteers contributed over
550 hours of their time and logged over 7000 miles while delivering
critically needed equipment or services.



Cisco has also launched a Hurricane Helene giving opportunity for employees
who wish to support relief efforts carried about by the American Red Cross
<https://www.redcross.org>, World Central Kitchen <https://wck.org>, and
Americares <https://my.americares.org/>. For the full story, read our blog

*Science Buddies inspires STEM engagement among young learners*



Cisco social impact partner Science Buddies
<https://www.sciencebuddies.org> aims
to make STEM education accessible and engaging, especially in underfunded
or resource-limited communities. Tammy Sila, a 4th-grade teacher at Whiting
Elementary School in a small rural town, utilized Science Buddies to engage
her students in STEM activities. She emphasized the importance of these
resources in establishing an after-school STEM club, noting that without
them, the club wouldn't have continued. Tammy used Science Buddies to
introduce her students to new areas like coding and electrical projects.
The Topic Selection Wizard was particularly helpful, allowing students to
find projects that matched their interests and giving them a sense of
ownership. Tammy credited Science Buddies with keeping students excited
about STEM, highlighting their willingness to stay after school to learn
more.

*Study shows that TalkingPoints' platform reduced absenteeism by 24%*



Cisco social impact partner TalkingPoints helps educators stay in closer
touch with families. Researchers found that using TalkingPoints resulted in
statistically significant improvements in attendance rates, resulting in
increased learning hours for students:



   - TalkingPoints led to an average 24% decrease in absenteeism rates
   across all grades with sufficient sample sizes (K-5, 7). Gains for
   Spanish-speaking students were more significant than for their
   English-speaking peers.
   - On average, attendance increases equate to an additional two days in
   school per student during the period studied. Extrapolating these results
   through the entire school year would mean an average gain of six additional
   days in school per student.

*Ten Strands works to bring environmental literacy to California public
schools*



Cisco social impact partner Ten Strands <https://tenstrands.org/> is a
California-based nonprofit with a mission to build and strengthen the
partnerships and strategies to bring environmental literacy to all of
California's TK-12 public school students. Their strategy is grounded in
three priorities: advocating for state investments in environmental and
climate literacy, building the capacity of districts and county offices of
education to implement proven strategies for scaling widespread educational
change, and strengthening the statewide network of dedicated partners in
the education sector.



Ten Strands' K-12 Climate Change and Environmental Justice Program, now
titled ""Seeds to Solutions,"" will empower students to be environmentally
literate, engaged community members prepared to act for the well-being of
their family, broader community, and environment. Developed as open
education resources for teaching and learning, these curricular materials
will enable curriculum developers, educators, community partners, and
professional learning experts to create locally relevant productive
adaptations. Cisco's investment in interoperability and identifying the
optimal technology platform to deliver the program's curriculum units will
allow the resources to be widely used across California and possibly beyond.

*Living Goods works to scale up community health plans in Africa*



Cisco's social impact partner Living Goods <https://livinggoods.org/> has
long understood the unique role that community health workers (CHWs) can
play in their communities. In September at the 79th Session of the UN
General Assembly (UNGA 79), leaders from Uganda, Malawi, Tanzania, Côte
d'Ivoire, and Liberia engaged in a powerful dialogue on scaling community
health initiatives. Hosted by Africa Frontline First and Africa CDC, the

Dear Madam/Sir,
Greetings from All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) ..!

We are pleased to inform you that the Ministry of Electronics and
Information Technology (MeitY) is organizing a *online live talk show *on
the *Academic Bank of Credits(ABC)*, a project of the Ministry of Education
(MoE) aimed at providing a seamless, student-centric learning experience
while enhancing the ease of credit accumulation and transfer for students
across institutions.

As part of the outreach efforts under the Digital India Initiative, MeitY
is hosting the 3rd episode of the “Ask Our Expert Programme” focused on
ABC-NAD. This programme will be held *on November 8, 2024, starting at 1 PM
onwards*. The live talk show will be conducted by experts from the
government, featuring focused discussions aimed at equipping faculty,
students, and administrators from various Academic Institutions (AIs) with
essential knowledge about the benefits, implementation process, and
opportunities associated with the ABC.Given the role that these
stakeholders play in the success of the Academic Bank of Credits, we
earnestly urge you to encourage and facilitate their participation in this
session.

The details for joining the webinar are mentioned below:-

·         *Date*: 8th November 2024
·       *  Time*: 1 PM onwards
·         *Platform*: YouTube Official Digital India Channel
·         *Link*: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqIoGwIXjoM

This session will not only deepen the understanding of participants about
ABC but also align them with the Digital India vision for a more connected
and efficient educational ecosystem. The insights shared during this will
empower faculty to effectively leverage ABC, support students in their
academic journeys and help administrators optimize institutional credit
management practices.

We trust that this collaboration will greatly benefit our educational
community, ultimately contributing to a more integrated and accessible
learning environment for all.

For any further assistance, Mr. Gaurav Khare may kindly be contacted at
gaurav.khare1@digitalindia.gov.in.

Thank you for your support in encouraging faculty and students to engage in
the future of e-governance and collaborative technology platforms.

In view of the foregoing,  AICTE requests your institution to share this
information with all the faculty, students, staff, and others, so that they
can benefit from it.

*With regards*

Dear Vice Chancellor/Director/Principal/ Dean,

Greetings from AICTE!

As you know, Yuva Sangam is a key initiative under the Ek Bharat Shreshtha
Bharat (EBSB) program, launched by the Hon'ble Prime Minister of India.
This flagship program facilitates exposure tours for youth primarily
students from Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) to experience diverse
cultures and achievements across different states. Through these exchanges,
we aim to foster national integration and understanding among young people.

Yuva Sangam not only emphasizes cultural exchange but also includes
activities designed to enhance leadership, sports, and soft skills.
Participants will engage in workshops on communication and teamwork, take
part in sports events organized by SAI, and have the chance to interact
with VVIPs and notable personalities from the host state.

The success of previous Yuva Sangam phases underscores the vital role of
youth in building connections across communities. This initiative has
positively impacted the lives of thousands, contributing to a more united
and inclusive India.

I encourage you to motivate your students to register for Yuva Sangam
Phase-5, an enriching student exchange program under EBSB.

Registration is open from *October 10, 2024* to *October 21, 2024* and can
be completed online at https://ebsb.aicte-india.org/.

Please find attached a document with strategies to inspire student
registrations for Yuva Sangam.

Combating Corruption


Detailed Problem Statement (Must be clear, specific and without any  
grammatical errors) *


Corruption undermines public institutions, hampers economic growth, and  
erodes trust in governance. It occurs when individuals misuse their power  
for personal gain, often at the cost of public welfare.


CIA method of questioning

Answers must be of minimum 150 words and meaningful.
AI generated copy paste will impact your final marks.


Why does this problem need to be solved?
*


Solving the problem of corruption is crucial because it directly threatens  
the functioning and stability of societies. It undermines the integrity of  
public institutions, leading to poor governance, inefficiency, and mistrust  
in leaders. Corruption hinders economic growth by diverting public  
resources for private gain, discouraging foreign investment, and creating  
an uneven playing field for businesses. This leads to poverty, inequality,  
and reduced access to essential services such as education, healthcare, and  
infrastructure.


What benefits come from solving the problem?
*


Stronger Economic Growth Improved Public Services Increased Trust in  
Institutions


What don't you understand yet?
*


What remains unclear is the specific context or focus of the corruption  
issue you are addressing.


What information do you have? Is it sufficient? Is it contradictory?
*


Definition and forms of corruption Consequences Global prevalence


Put a boundary around the problem-be clear about what is not the problem.
*


General inefficiency or incompetence Legal lobbying or advocacy Cultural or  
societal practices


What are the various parts of the problem? Identify and describe the  
relationships among the parts.
*


1. Political Corruption Definition: Misuse of public office or political  
power for private gain. 2. Economic Corruption Corruption that distorts  
market mechanisms and economic policies for personal or corporate gain. 3.  
Institutional Corruption Corruption that occurs within organizations,  
including businesses, law enforcement, and other institutions.


What cannot be changed about the problem? (Don't assume something can't be  
changed when in fact it can.)
*


Human Nature and Greed Cultural Norms


Think of another case of this same problem, but perhaps in a slightly  
different form, or in a different area altogether. Can you use the same  
solution, or the method that led to that solution?
*


Misuse of Power Impact on Public Welfare Cyclical Nature

અમલ માટે, E-KYC ને લગતી કામગીરી ને અગ્રતા આપી સમયસર પુર્ણ કરવા આથી
આજ્ઞાનુસાર જણાવવામાં આવે છે.

How Context Switching Wrecks Your Focus & What to Do About It


Context switching is the pesky mental hiccup that happens when you shift your 
focus from one task to another. Between meetings, Slack messages, and projects,

Yes, You Can Become a Software Engineer Without a CS Degree

unique life experience an asset.

The lecture offered a well-rounded approach, combining theoretical  
frameworks and practical examples. Introducing the Kepner-Tregoe (KT)  
Method as a structured problem-solving tool was valuable. The method's  
step-by-step approach for issue analysis, decision-making, and potential  
problem analysis stood out as a practical guide for real-world  
applications. The explanation of the KT Method was clear and easy to  
follow. Breaking down the method into key components (Situation Analysis,  
Problem Analysis, Decision Analysis, and Potential Problem Analysis) helped  
in grasping the concept. I appreciate the focus on innovation techniques  
like brainstorming, lateral thinking, and the creative problem-solving  
process. However, some of the more abstract concepts could benefit from  
additional real-world examples.

The Women Development Cell is organizing an expert session on “ UnTabooing
Menstruation and Sanitary Pads 🩸” on September 16, 2024.

The session is designed for university girl students, Teaching and
Non-teaching females to break the taboo around menstruation and promote
better menstrual hygiene practices.

This initiative aims to create a safe and open environment for discussing
menstrual health, combat societal taboos, and equip students with knowledge

By fostering this understanding, I hope to encourage positive attitudes
toward menstrual health, which is crucial for young women's overall
well-being and empowerment.

One learner's transformation


After a business setback, Pradeep learned coding on Codecademy to build a new 
career. Within a year, he landed an internship, and today, he is a Software 
Engineer II at a San Francisco tech company.

Whenever I needed [to learn] any language, I could do it on Codecademy. Taking 
the courses, it’s like a user-friendly thing. It’s not a steep learning curve.

Respected Madam/Sir,


Greetings from AURO University, Surat, Gujarat

Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, popularly known as Mahatma Gandhi, is regarded
as the Father of Nation by Indians. The celebrations of his 155th birth
anniversary on 2nd October are less for the ceremonial significance but
more to inculcate the values, principles, patriotism and frugality in the
youth. The life and teachings of Mahatma Gandhi are still relevant today in
every sphere of life. The renowned scientist of India and a pioneer of the
Indian Innovation movement, Dr R A Mashelkar talks of a concept called
Gandhian Engineering which is basically to focus on masses from less
resources, called MLM - More from Less for More.


This concept and approach is quite important for budding entrepreneurs and
startups. Keeping this concept at the core of the heart, AURO University
has an annual event called 'Gandhian Engineering Idea Competition' open for
Sr. Secondary school students, UG, PG and Doctoral students.

AURO University is happy to announce the launch of this year's competition.
Those who want to be part of this competition can register themselves.



You have always been supportive to the startup and innovation movement in
Gujarat and India. May we request your good offices to circulate the
information about this competition to all the students/networks of your
institution/University. It is an international level competition and
participation of your institution would make a big impact.



*No Engineering or Technological background is required to participate. It
is not about competition in hard core Engineering concepts. ""Engineering""
here means how do you make others' life simple and cheerful by providing
ideas which are frugal and inclusive. The ideas are accepted from any field
and from everyone (irrespective of their educational background and
certifications). *


The registration link for participation in this Competition is :


https://forms.gle/xoRZEA5iDJN2JrkU7

Last date to participate in the Competition : 25th September, 2024



Announcement of Winners : 2nd October, 2024


We will be providing cash prizes, certificates, recognition and mentoring
to the deserving ideas /innovations. We are also inviting entries for
design improvements and also in the following categories :



1. Pedagogical Innovations
2. Ideas and Innovations for implementation of NEP-2020
3. Ideas for Viksit Bharat @2047
4. Ideas and Innovations for promoting BKS (Bhartiya Knowledge System).


All students are encouraged to apply in this competition. For more details,
please refer to the attached documents.


Looking forward to your support and guidance for making this Gujarat
competition an international level competition.


with warm regards,


Team, Gandhian Engineering
