Hi Dr. Priteshkumar,

Amidst the hype surrounding AI-driven cyber threats, what's actually
happening in the wild?

In our upcoming webinar, Adversarial misuse of generative AI: Analysis
beyond the hype
<https://go.cloudplatformonline.com/dc/j-0ZLuKiroz5jBuK2yHK5CJ6ILCpYkKSM2bjwsh0ZRMQWGeonCIIqpEhYE0ycwQp5zliZX7ciSPAjlpccRbKFqvx5lx-Jyj_SUG898ZDn477QCReC6HR4r3n13FDkUkBuVBY1NouHkxwjjD3Z11ExZi4XAg2R5ylNZo1sYxqU0BISMFjoMyNmFbCHqs4pV3KL5G9jKpk9DHcMjxeZbEvB4GZEiKCupnZ64lI0qVNif3NjQuidsj0p5raJ14UR3pQLLi0e0PqYZJjRAvjef8Lm3x-5Qg-T6MitLrLnYBeCWh4HBifAo-rPyA2-Aak5cG7/ODA4LUdKVy0zMTQAAAGaKUvWtr6AASl06eicAURpSlDiyESFNOO01MWKQNcz8ob0uCysvXvBsj0UTstrZr3yVX0jnZI=>,
Google Threat Intelligence experts move beyond theoretical discussions of
abuse of AI, drawing on real-world observations of how government-backed
threat actors have attempted to misuse Google’s AI-powered assistant Gemini
for cyber attacks and information operations.

Our goal is to shed light on these activities with security professionals
to raise awareness and enable stronger protections for all.

*Topics covered include:*

   - Specific cases of attempted misuse of Gemini by nation-state threat
   actors.
   - How AI is being leveraged across various stages of cyberattacks, from
   initial reconnaissance to post-compromise activities.
   - In-depth analysis of government-backed threat activity and if it
   represents novel or unique AI-enabled attack or abuse techniques.

*EC-Council has launched Hackerverse **Capture the Flag (CTF) challenge**.
Find the details below and register using your CHARUSAT email id for the

Hackerverse is a global cybersecurity competition ecosystem designed by
EC-Council to support and advance the cybersecurity community worldwide.
Rooted in EC-Council’s longstanding commitment to empowering cybersecurity
professionals worldwide, Hackerverse provides a competitive arena for
individuals across all proficiency levels to demonstrate their skills
through rigorous, gamified *Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges*.

Hackerverse was officially unveiled at Hacker Halted 2022, EC-Council’s
annual cybersecurity conference that unites ethical hackers, security
professionals, and industry leaders from across the globe. A platform for
thought leadership and technical exchange, Hacker Halted serves as a
convergence point for innovation, research, and discourse on emerging cyber
threats and defense strategies.

Hackerverse has helped EC-Council to broaden its impact, transitioning from
localized cybersecurity competitions to a truly global competitive
platform. *Through Hackerverse CTF, a year-long, free-to-enter Capture the
Flag (CTF) challenge on Hackerverse, cybersecurity professionals and
enthusiasts from around the world can now test their skills on a much
larger stage. *The competition features a dynamic scoring system that
rewards participants for speed and precision, reflecting the high-stakes
nature of cybersecurity. *With over $100,000 in prizes, it represents
EC-Council’s commitment to supporting and rewarding cybersecurity talent
worldwide.*

As cyber threats continue to evolve, Hackerverse remains a dynamic proving
ground, ensuring that the next generation of cybersecurity professionals is
prepared to meet the challenges of an increasingly complex digital
landscape.

Sure! Bevel gears are used to transmit power between intersecting shafts,
typically at a 90-degree angle. Here's a breakdown of how teeth, speed, and
travel interact in bevel gears:
*Teeth*

   - *Tooth Profile*: Bevel gears can have straight, spiral, or hypoid
   teeth. Straight teeth are simpler but noisier at high speeds. Spiral teeth
   provide smoother engagement and higher efficiency [1]
   <https://engineersguidebook.com/bevel-gears-types-and-applications/>.
   - *Pitch Cone*: The imaginary cone that represents the gear’s pitch
   surface [1]
   <https://engineersguidebook.com/bevel-gears-types-and-applications/>.
   - *Tooth Count*: The number of teeth affects the gear ratio, which
   determines the speed and torque conversion [2]
   <https://www.cnclathing.com/guide/gear-types-classification-functions-teeth-profile-nomenclature-calculation>
   .

*Speed*

   - *Gear Ratio*: The ratio of the number of teeth on the driven gear to
   the driving gear. For example, a 20-tooth driving gear meshed with a
   40-tooth driven gear creates a 2:1 gear ratio, resulting in the driven gear
   rotating at half the speed but delivering twice the torque [2]
   <https://www.cnclathing.com/guide/gear-types-classification-functions-teeth-profile-nomenclature-calculation>
   .
   - *Efficiency*: Spiral bevel gears are more efficient at higher speeds
   due to their smoother tooth engagement [1]
   <https://engineersguidebook.com/bevel-gears-types-and-applications/>.

*Travel*

   - *Torque Conversion*: Bevel gears modify torque, trading off speed for
   rotational force. Higher torque is achieved at lower speeds and vice versa
   [2]
   <https://www.cnclathing.com/guide/gear-types-classification-functions-teeth-profile-nomenclature-calculation>
   .
   - *Direction Change*: Bevel gears are designed to change the direction
   of rotation, which is crucial in applications like automotive differentials
   [1] <https://engineersguidebook.com/bevel-gears-types-and-applications/>.

Would you like more detailed information on a specific type of bevel gear
or its applications?

Respected Sir/Madam,

Crossword-solving is a powerful cognitive exercise that enhances analytical
thinking, decision-making, memory, concentration, and creativity. It
strengthens problem-solving abilities, fosters a competitive spirit, and
expands vocabulary—skills essential for academic and professional success.

To further promote this engaging and intellectually stimulating activity in
higher education institutions, AICTE, Extra-C, IIM Mumbai, and IIT Madras
have collaborated under an MoU signed on May 21, 2024. As part of this
initiative, the *National Inter-College Crossword Expedition (NICE-25)* is
being organized.

The competition, scheduled between *May and August 2025*, will follow a
hybrid format—online preliminary rounds leading to offline zonal and
national finals. This event provides students with an opportunity to
sharpen their minds while competing on a national platform.

*Attached are the competition guidelines, format, and tentative schedule. *The
MoU can be accessed on the AICTE website. We invite your esteemed
institution to encourage participation in this unique and enriching
challenge https://nice.crypticsingh.com

Subject: Participation of Students, Teachers, and Administrators in the
‘Ask Our Expert’ Programme on NAD-ABC on November 8, 2024 -Regarding


Dear Madam/Sir,
Greetings from All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) ..!

We are pleased to inform you that the Ministry of Electronics and
Information Technology (MeitY) is organizing a *online live talk show *on
the *Academic Bank of Credits(ABC)*, a project of the Ministry of Education
(MoE) aimed at providing a seamless, student-centric learning experience
while enhancing the ease of credit accumulation and transfer for students
across institutions.

As part of the outreach efforts under the Digital India Initiative, MeitY
is hosting the 3rd episode of the “Ask Our Expert Programme” focused on
ABC-NAD. This programme will be held *on November 8, 2024, starting at 1 PM
onwards*. *The live talk show will be conducted by experts from the
government, featuring focused discussions aimed at equipping faculty,
students, and administrators from various Academic Institutions (AIs) with
essential knowledge about the benefits, implementation process, and
opportunities associated with the ABC*.Given the role that these
stakeholders play in the success of the Academic Bank of Credits, we
earnestly urge you to encourage and facilitate their participation in this
session.

The details for joining the webinar are mentioned below:-

·         *Date*: 8th November 2024
·       *  Time*: 1 PM onwards
·         *Platform*: YouTube Official Digital India Channel
·         *Link*: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqIoGwIXjoM

This session will not only deepen the understanding of participants about
ABC but also align them with the Digital India vision for a more connected
and efficient educational ecosystem. The insights shared during this will
empower faculty to effectively leverage ABC, support students in their
academic journeys and help administrators optimize institutional credit
management practices.

We trust that this collaboration will greatly benefit our educational
community, ultimately contributing to a more integrated and accessible
learning environment for all.

For any further assistance, Mr. Gaurav Khare may kindly be contacted at
gaurav.khare1@digitalindia.gov.in.

Thank you for your support in encouraging faculty and students to engage in
the future of e-governance and collaborative technology platforms.

In view of the foregoing,  AICTE requests your institution to share this
information with all the faculty, students, staff, and others, so that they
can benefit from it.

Session by IIT Ropar. Enhance chances of securing high-paying jobs and
internships in the field of artificial intelligence

Dear Professor Dr.Mihir Bhatt,

Earlier this month, one of the IITs organised a live online session to
guide students in getting jobs and internships. These programs organised as
part of the NEP 2020 have tremendously helped students in getting jobs and
internships. We appreciate your support, Professor, in spreading the word.
Your assistance in helping students build their careers is commendable.
Thank you!



While the job market has been slow, the field of AI (Artificial
Intelligence) is experiencing a high demand for engineers, developers and
students with knowledge in this area.



Keeping this in mind, I am happy to share that Indian Institute of
Technology (IIT) Ropar is organising a session on this topic of 'Maximise
Job & Internship Oppotunities: How to get a Minor in AI (Artificial
Intelligence) from IIT for Better Placements'.
