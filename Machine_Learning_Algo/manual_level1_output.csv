KodeKloud Team <welcome@team.kodekloud.com>,team.kodekloud.com,"anyone can pick up devops - part 3 - jenkins build-3 or how we bring the ingredients together! kodekloud-logo-new ( ) “i'll curse myself forever. this nasty soup we're in is largely of my own brewing.” - adam west as batman in batman the tv show (1966) this is the third email on devops processes known as devops 101 or the software soup. it looked like this when we last talked about it: - plan-1 ( ) the soup recipe - create (code-2) ( ) and assemble the ingredients for the soup as well as the tools - build-3 or cook the soup - test-4 the soup for quality - release-5 the soup to the front end shop to prep for presentation - deploy-6 the soup into bowls for consumption by the customer - operate-7 the front-end shop so that soup can flow to the customer - monitoring-8 the customer experience of the soup by checking temp, etc, and maintaining a good experience for the customer replace “soup” with “software” if you are wondering what this has to do with information technology. now, this chapter of our journey takes into the concept of bringing all our ingredients together. in plan-1 ( ) , we figured out the software soup we wanted to make and planned for it. in code-2 ( ) , we created the software (code) feature by feature and put it into a git repository so we could bring all the code by the various developers together. our soup analogy focused on bringing all the ingredients together to the prepping station. in build-3, we have to “cook” or build our software soup. this is where the soup is made consumable. in software, we refer to this as building the software or packaging it for release and deployment. - building software & devops building software varies by programming language. for instance, java uses maven and gradle, while c uses make. - the universal build tool challenge we need a universal tool that can manage various language-specific build tools, much like a kitchen that can handle different cooking methods. - language-specific tools just as different dishes require unique pots and pans, programming languages like java, python, ruby, and rust have their distinct tools. - the ideal solution: a centralized cooking hub imagine a stove that can accommodate various cooking implements. this is what we need for diverse programming languages. - enter the build server a build server uses the native tools of a programming language to construct software. for java, it would utilize maven. - the need to know build tools & languages: it's essential to understand specific build tools and their corresponding programming languages. build servers, like stoves, adapt by using the right tool for the task. - jenkins: the leading ci/cd server jenkins, a renowned build server, is also a ci/cd (continuous integration and continuous delivery) server. familiarity with jenkins provides insight into most build servers. - the devops engineer's toolkit: mastering build servers to excel as a devops engineer, understanding build servers is crucial. if you're unfamiliar with them, spend 3 hours on kodekloud's jenkins course ( ) for hands-on learning. next up….. test-4 or how do we make sure the soup is tasty and delicious? kode kloud ( ) learning path ( ) | kodekloud engineer ( ) | playgrounds ( ) | pricing ( ) facebook ( ) linkedin ( ) x ( ) instagram ( ) youtube ( ) unsubscribe ( ) or manage preferences ( ) . kodekloud (brand owned by zaurac technologies pte. ltd.) 14 robinson road, #08-01a far east finance building, singapore, central singapore, 048545 singapore view in browser ( )",,,,
